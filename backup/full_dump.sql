41	2607863	Lab: Problem Solve 0	ITSC 1212 Problem Solve 0 Overview and Instructions Overview In this activity, you’ll explore computational thinking by designing your own ASCII artwork using just your keyboard, a text editor, and your imagination. You’ll create two different images: one that fits in a 5x5 grid, and another in a 10x10 grid. Have fun and be creative! Instructions Go through the tabs on left to right to get oriented, understand your task, and gather what you need. Start from the top and move down. Preliminaries Creating artwork with a computer keyboard is called ASCII art. You probably do not know ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. It is a set of characters (letters, numbers, punctuation) originally based on the English alphabet that encodes 128 specified characters: the numbers 0-9, the letters a-z and A-Z, some basic punctuation symbols, and a few other characters. Only 95 of the ASCII characters actually print, however, and they’re all on your computer keyboard. It’s fun and easy to create ASCII art with your computer keyboard, a text editor, and your imagination. While ASCII characters are used to transmit, store, and display data, people have found another use for them: create art. Here is the simplest possible example of ASCII art, an emoticon: @}-;-‘— It’s a rose, if you have not guessed, with the flower on the left and ; and ‘ as thorns. Creating this emoticon is a great way to start to play with the possibilities of letters, numbers, and punctuation to create images.  Here’s another easy example, from the Wikipedia article on ASCII art: (\\_/) (=’.’=) (“)_(“) We can even be creative writing text: 88   88  8888888  88      88       .d888b. 88   88  88       88      88      d8P" "Y8b 8888888  888888   88      88      88     88 88   88  88       88      88      88     88 88   88  8888888  888888  888888   "Y888P" ... I think you get the idea ;-) Understanding Files and the File System Why is the important? Every time you use a computer, you are interacting with files and folders — even if you don’t notice it. Your photos, essays, songs, and documents are all files, and the file system is what keeps them organized. Without a file system, it would be impossible to find, save, or open anything on your computer. For anyone using technology to solve problems, this knowledge is essential because every solution you create will likely need to save, load, or organize files. Misunderstanding how file systems work often leads to errors like “file not found.” Knowing how to navigate and organize files is a core problem‑solving skill for using computers effectively. What is a File? A file is a collection of information stored on a computer. Files can contain text (essays), images, music, videos, or apps. Every file has a name and usually an extension (e.g., .docx , .jpg , .mp3 ) indicating its type. What is a File System? A file system is how a computer organizes and keeps track of files. Think of it like a library: Books → files Shelves & sections → folders Catalog system → file system The file system makes sure files don’t get lost, you can find them quickly, and apps know where to look for information. File System Example (Tree Diagram) /Home\n ├── Documents\n │    ├── Assignments\n │    │    └── lab1.txt\n │    └── essay.docx\n ├── Pictures\n │    └── photo.jpg\n └── Music\n      └── song.mp3 How to read this: Home is the root folder. Documents , Pictures , and Music are subfolders. Files like lab1.txt , essay.docx , photo.jpg , and song.mp3 live inside those folders. Absolute Path An absolute path starts from the very top of the file system (the root ). It always tells the full route to a file and always starts with / . /Home/Documents/Assignments/lab1.txt / = root ( Home ) Documents → folder inside Home Assignments → folder inside Documents problem_solve0.txt → file Relative Path A relative path starts from your current location in the file system. . = current folder .. = one folder up (parent) Examples (starting in /Home/Documents ): Assignments/lab1.txt          ← go down into Assignments\n..                            ← go up to /Home\n../Pictures/photo.jpg         ← up one, then into Pictures Quick Comparison Absolute Path Relative Path Always starts at root / Starts from current location Works no matter where you are Depends on where you are Longer, but less ambiguous Shorter, but context‑sensitive Tools You'll Need A simple text editor like: Notepad (Windows) TextEdit (Mac — make sure it's in plain text mode!) 🐥 Go to: Format --> Make plain text For more instructions on macOS, visit this document Or a free editor like Notepad++ or VS Code Set your editor to use a monospaced font like Courier. This ensures all characters take up the same width and height which is very important for keeping your art aligned! Your Task Open a new text file and create two pieces of ASCII art: One small image that fits in a 5x5 grid (5 characters wide × 5 lines tall) One larger image that fits in a 10x10 grid (10 characters wide × 10 lines tall) You can do this on pen and paper or you can try using this web based tool . You can draw anything you like (e.g., faces, animals, robots, trees, symbols,...) as long as it fits in the grid and follows the guidelines. Now that we’re starting to work with and create files, set up a special folder on your computer to store all of your coursework for this class. This will keep your work organized and easy to find for future assignments. Place the text file containing your ASCII art into this folder. For extra organization, you can create a subfolder (e.g., named Labs or Problem-Solving Work ) to hold your lab activities separately from other coursework. Write down both the absolute path and the relative path as if you are starting inside the Desktop folder (pretend your current location is Desktop and show how to navigate to your file). Tips for Making Great ASCII Art Use thin characters (like . : ') to create light areas. Use wide or bold characters (like M, W, @, #) to create darker areas. Characters like J, G, and P can help create curves and texture. You can build your image line by line (like typing a poem), or sketch a grid of spaces and fill in characters in precise spots (like a puzzle). Don’t be afraid to experiment! You can revise and refine your artwork just like debugging a program. Deliverables When you’re done, follow the instructions below to submit your ASCII art and knowledge check: Save your work as a plain text file named: problem_solve0.txt Your work includes the 5x5 and 10x10 ASCII art and the path to the file you created. Both of these should be in the file. Export or print it as a PDF 🐥 Not sure how to do this? Just check in with a TA or share your question on NinerLink, someone will guide you through it How to Submit Upload the PDF file to Gradescope. Knowledge Check ASCII art projects also feel like puzzles you sit with for hours to piece together on a table. You type characters on your keyboard instead of fish out pieces from a box to match an empty spot in your puzzle. But what is even cooler, is that there's not just one piece that could work for that empty spot-- there are countless possibilities. Each character you choose can subtly change the texture, shading, and overall look of your art, giving you endless opportunities to experiment and refine your design. This flexibility allows you to express your creativity in unique ways, making the process both challenging and rewarding. As you create your ASCII art, you're actually practicing key skills that are part of computational thinking . Decomposition – breaking your image into parts Pattern Recognition – reusing shapes and symmetry Abstraction – using characters to represent shapes and shading Algorithmic Thinking – deciding the sequence of characters and lines	\N	f	f	\N	252047	202580-Fall 2025-ITSC-1212_Combined

51	2650779	Lab: Problem Solve 2	ITSC 1212 Problem Solve 2 Overview and Instructions Overview In the prepwork for this week you learned that computers use only zero and one to store everything that you see on a computer - words, numbers, pictures, movies and even sound. Images are stored using grids of 0's and 1's, movies are stored as sequences of images Music is stored by representing pulses of the speaker. Each pulse is a 1. The goal for this lab is to get a better understanding of how information is represented on computers. If you need a refresher on these topics, check the resources in the Module 1: Learning Guide (under Prep-Work). Instructions Preliminaries Computers today use the binary system to represent information. It is called binary because only two different digits are used. It is also known as base two (humans normally use base 10). Each zero or one is called a bit (binary digit). A bit is usually represented in a computer’s main memory by a transistor that is switched on or off, or a capacitor that is charged or discharged. When data must be transmitted over a telephone line or radio link, high and low-pitched tones are used for the ones and zeros. On magnetic disks (floppy disks and hard disks) and tapes, bits are represented by the direction of a magnetic field on a coated surface, either North-South or South-North. Audio CDs, CD-ROMs and DVDs store bits optically—the part of the surface corresponding to a bit either does or does not reflect light. One bit on its own can’t represent much, so they are usually grouped together in groups of eight, which can represent numbers from 0 to 255. A group of eight bits is called a byte. The speed of a computer depends on the number of bits it can process at once. For example, a 32-bit computer can process 32-bit numbers in one operation, while a 16-bit computer must break 32-bit numbers down into smaller pieces, making it slower. Ultimately bits and bytes are all that a computer uses to store and transmit numbers, text, and all other information. ASCII, which stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard that represents text in computers and other devices. It assigns unique numerical codes to a set of 128 characters, including letters, numerals, punctuation marks, and control characters. ASCII provides a standardized way for computers to exchange textual information, forming a foundational element in the realm of character encoding. The following table is a subset of the ASCII chart for the printable characters you see on a computer keyboard. It also includes the encoding for the delete command. Each row corresponds to a specific character and columns display relevant information such as the decimal and binary representations of the characters. The ASCII chart is a valuable resource for understanding the numerical codes assigned to different characters, making it easier to work with and interpret textual data in computing and communication systems. In this lab, you’ll use a deck of 8 cards to act out how binary works, and then you’ll use that understanding to encode your own name into binary. Use this Google Doc to compile your work to the following tasks in a single document to submit for this lab. Task 1 You have 8 cards, each representing one bit. From left to right the place values are: 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 A face-up card means 1 (on). A face-down card means 0 (off). Add the values of the face-up cards to get a decimal number. Q1: If you flip up the cards 64, 16, and 1, what decimal number do you get? Q2: What ASCII character does it represent? Here is a digital version of the binary cards . Click on a card to flip it between 0 (off) and 1 (on). Use this tool if you don’t have the physical cards available. Task 2 Now imagine that the following row of light bulbs represent the switches in a computer. A glowing yellow bulb represents an "on" (1) switch/bit and a dim gray light bulb represents an "off" (0) switch. Using your 8 cards to represent one byte, break the sequence of light bulbs into groups of 8 bits. Then, follow the same steps from the previous task (convert binary --> decimal --> ASCII) to find the decoded message. Q3: What is the decoded message? Task 3 Now it’s your turn to create a message in binary using your name. Write down your full name (first and last) Q4: How many bits are needed for your first name? Q5: How many bits are needed for your full name? Remember to include spaces! Q6: Write the binary, decimal, and ASCII for the first three letters of your name. Use your last name if your first name is shorter than three letters. Record your binary sequence neatly, grouping the 0s and 1s into chunks of 4 or 8 for readability. Task 4 Now let’s explore how case (upper vs. lower) is represented differently in ASCII. Look at the binary encoding of your name from the previous task. Did you use uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or a mix? Create another version of your name using a different letter case (for example: all uppercase). Convert the first three letters from this new version of your name into binary using the ASCII chart. Compare the two representations (your original from the previous task vs. this new version). Q7 : Write the binary, decimal, and ASCII for the second representation of your letters. Q8 : What differences do you see in the binary codes between uppercase and lowercase letters? Q9: Why do you think ASCII assigns different values for uppercase and lowercase? Deliverables When you’re done, follow the instructions below to submit a PDF version of your work Download a copy of your Google Doc file as a PDF Document (.pdf) You are expected to submit and review your work in order for this activity to marked as complete. During the review you are expected to use correct terminology, describe the steps taken and choices made when you were solving the problems. The review is intended to provide you with the opportunity to practice reflective thinking about the design and implementation choices made during problem solving.

A bit is the smallest unit; 8 bits = 1 byte (enough to represent 256 values). Bits are stored or transmitted in different physical ways (electric signals, magnetic fields, light, sound). ASCII is the standard code that lets computers represent letters, numbers, and symbols as binary. Uppercase and lowercase letters have different binary codes, so case matters! The more bits a computer can process at once, the faster it can handle data.	\N	f	f	\N	252047	202580-Fall 2025-ITSC-1212_Combined
52	2650860	Lab: Problem Solve 1	ITSC 1212 Problem Solve 1 Overview and Instructions Overview In the prepwork for this week you learned computers may seem smart, but at their core they are just analytical machines: devices that follow rules step by step. This idea began almost 200 years ago with Charles Babbage’s design for the Analytical Engine and Ada Lovelace’s insight that such a machine could manipulate not only numbers, but also symbols, patterns, and even music. In this activity, you’ll explore how a computer works by: Comparing a single-purpose calculating machine with a general-purpose analytical machine. Acting out the roles of a computer’s parts (input, memory, processor, control, output). Following simple symbol rules to see how complexity can emerge from simple steps. The goal is to see that a computer doesn’t “think”, it just follows rules and its power comes from being able to follow any set of rules we design. If you need a refresher on these topics, check the resources in the Module 1: Learning Guide (under Prep-Work). Instructions This activity is designed to be completed during your scheduled lab session. It  works best when everyone sees the results evolve together. The discussion questions are meant to be interactive and guided through each step. Using this Google Doc record your answers to the questions for each task as you work through the lab. Compile all of your responses in this single document, to submit it when you finish. Task 1 Analytical vs. Calculating Machines Think about the following two points and answer the following question: A calculating machine solves a single problem, like adding two numbers. An analytical machine can follow a sequence of rules (like a recipe) to solve many different problems. Q1: Why would a machine that can follow any set of rules be more powerful than one that can only add numbers? Task 2 Input, Output, and Memory You and your classmates will role-play the different parts of a computer: Input Clerk: provides instructions (like recipe cards). Store (Memory): keeps track of values. Mill (Processor): does the calculations. Control Unit: makes sure the steps are followed in the right order. Output Clerk: announces the results. Follow this recipe as a group and answer the following question Input Clerk writes down two numbers on cards and gives them to the Store. Control Unit tells the Mill: “Add the two numbers.” Mill gives the result to the Store. Control Unit tells the Mill: “Multiply the result by 2.” Mill gives the final result to the Output Clerk. Output Clerk announces the result to the class. Q2: Did the machine (your classmates) need to understand the numbers to follow the steps? Why or why not? Task 3 Analytical vs. Calculating Task Try these two tasks and answer the following questions: Task #1-  Add 37 + 59 Task #2 -Follow this recipe with any two numbers: Add the two numbers. Multiply the result by 2. Announce the answer. Q3: Which task could be used for many inputs? Q4: Which is limited to one specific problem? Q5: Why does this show the difference between calculating vs. analytical machines? Task 4 Symbol Puzzle Computers don’t just work with numbers, they can follow rules for symbols too. In this task, you will act like the computer: take a starting symbol and apply the rules exactly as written, without guessing or making changes. Rules: - Rule 1: If you see A, replace it with BC. - Rule 2: If you see C, replace it with AB. Start with the symbol: A. Look at each letter and apply the rules. Example: If you have A, it becomes BC. If you have C, it becomes AB. Do this for 6 times, writing down the result each time. Don’t change the rules or skip a step. Remember, you’re the computer! Q6: Did the rules feel smart, or were you just following steps? What does this show about how computers work? Deliverables When you’re done, follow the instructions below to submit a PDF version of your work Download a copy of your Google Doc file as a PDF Document (.pdf) To get full credit for this activity, you’ll need to submit and review your work. The review isn’t just a requirement, it’s your chance to step back, use the right terminology, and explain the steps and choices you made while working through these tasks. Think of this as an opportunity to strengthen your problem-solving skills and to build the habit of reflecting on your decisions. The more you practice looking at how you approach problems, the more confident and effective you’ll become at tackling new challenges. Be sure to complete your review during the week it’s assigned so the experience stays fresh and meaningful. You may finish it at the end of the lab session when the work is assigned, or during office hours later that week. How to Submit Upload the PDF file to Gradescope. Knowledge Check Computers don’t “understand” like humans do, they just carry out instructions step by step A calculating machine solves one fixed problem (e.g., adding two numbers) while an analytical machine can follow many different instructions, making it general-purpose. Core parts of a computer: Input, Memory, Processor (Mill), Control, Output Complexity can emerge from simple repeated rules Computers can process not just numbers, but also text, images, sounds, and patterns, all because they are general-purpose analytical machines.	\N	f	f	\N	252047	202580-Fall 2025-ITSC-1212_Combined
53	2652184	Lab: Problem Solve 4	ITSC 1212 Problem Solve 4 Overview and Instructions Overview Up to now, we’ve been exploring ideas step by step, now you’ll start putting them together in code using Strype to build Python programs. What is Strype? Strype is a free, web-based editor that lets you write real Python code using frames. Each frame represents a step or instruction and together they build your program. Additionally each frame is a complete statement or block of code, so you can focus on logic instead of worrying about syntax and indentation errors. Remember that this is your first time seeing and using this new tool to actually write a program during lab. . Don’t worry if it feels unfamiliar at first; the goal is to experiment, practice, and get comfortable with the basics of programming in this environment. Instructions Using this Google Doc template compile your solutions in a single document to submit for this lab. Task 1: Meet Strype Go to https://strype.org Links to an external site. in your browser and click "Start coding now!" Explore the three main sections in the code area: Imports – bringing in libraries Function definitions – defining reusable code My code – where the main part of your code runs 3. The main idea behind Stype is frames. A frame in Strype is a building block of code.Instead of typing raw text (like in a normal text code-editor), you insert frames, and each frame contains one complete, valid statement or structure in Python.Think of frames like Lego bricks: Each brick has a defined shape (e.g., a print() statement, an if condition, or a loop). You can connect bricks together in a sequence to build a program. Some bricks are “containers” (like if or for ) and allow other frames to be placed inside them. 4. Frames appear in the frame palette under “My project” tab on the right side of the screen. The frame palette shows all the frames that can be added at each place based on the Python grammar. The symbols on the left side of the palette are the keyboard keys that spawn the frame to the position of the the frame cursor. They are your shortcuts. Clicking on a frame will insert it into the code editor, where you can then fill in the details. You can also drag and drop frames within the editor, making it easy to reorder your building blocks and adjust the flow of your program. 5. Clicking the Run icon will execute your program. 6. When your program runs, any results will show up in the console (the box where Strype prints messages). If your program asks for input, the console will pause and wait for you to type your answer directly into it. 7. Run the program to see what happens! 8. Now, change the text "Hello from Python!" (inside the double quotes) so it says hello to someone fun, maybe your best friend, your pet, your favorite celebrity, or even a superhero! 9. Run it again to check that your new message appears on the screen. 10. If you see an error, double-check that you kept the double quotes around your message. 11. Once you've got everything working as intended, take a screenshot of your Strype window and add it to your Google doc, Why inside the quotes? The quotes tell the computer, “Hey, this is just text!” That’s what we call a string. If you leave the quotes off, the computer will think you’re trying to use a variable or run a command and it won’t know what to do. So, what is it we're actually accomplishing here when we use a print statement? At its core, we're telling the computer to communicate outward. This belongs to the Talk --> Output action. The computer takes information stored internally (like text, numbers, or results of calculations) and outputs it so a human can see it. Just like when we talk to share what’s in our head, the computer “talks” through the screen, console, or window. Why should we care? Without output, a program would run silently and we’d have no way to know what it was doing. The print statement is often our very first tool for getting feedback from the computer, confirming that it remembered something correctly, made the right choice, or finished a loop. Task 2: ASCII Art In this task you will create a program that displays the ASCII art you sketched in Week 1 (Module 0).  Begin by deleting the existing frames so that you start with an empty program. To delete a frame, click on it and press the Delete key on your keyboard.Notice the blue frame curser it is an indicator of where you are currently editing and contextualizes the frames that can be added at its place ( think of it as an indicator of the active frame). It can be moved by either your mouse or keyboard.This is where the next frame you add will be inserted. Click the Function Call frame to add it to your program. For the function name, type print. Inside the parentheses, add quotation marks " ". Copy and paste the first row of your ASCII art from your text file into the quotes. Run your program by clicking the Run button and check that the first row of your ASCII art displays in the console. Repeat steps 1–5 for each row of your ASCII art until the full image appears. One thing to watch out for is whether your art includes double quotes. This can be tricky at first. If your new art needs a double quote inside it, you have two options: Escape the quote with a backslash, like this: print "(\\")_(\\")" Use single quotes around the whole string, like this: '(")_(")' Don’t worry if this feels confusing at the start. Handling quotes inside strings is something everyone runs into. With a little practice, it will start to feel natural. We're just getting started 🐣 Take a screenshot our your Strype window and add it to your Google doc. Task 3: Simple Calculation In this task you will work with the assignment and function call frames to create a simple program that will: Store a number, Calculate the next and previous numbers, and Display the results. To get started clear the Main Program frame so you’re working with a blank program. Insert an Assignment frame. . For the identifier, type num and for the value, enter this nested function call int(input()) This will create a frame that stores your first number. Let’s pause for a moment to check that everything is working as expected. Run the program and look closely: the main code area and the frame palette will turn gray. This means the program is running. In this case, it’s waiting for you to type something into the console. You’ll know it’s ready because you’ll see the blinking cursor. So what is happening here? - input() tells the computer to pause and wait for you to type something. - int(...) converts whatever you type into an integer (a whole number). So if you type 7, the program saves it as the number 7, not as the text "7". There’s a lot to unpack here, and that’s okay. In the upcoming weeks, we’ll work more with input, numbers, and text so you get comfortable with how this all fits together. Once you’ve confirmed that you can run the program and enter some text to finish it, go ahead and move on to the next step. Insert another Assignment frame. For the identifier, type next and for the value, type num + 1 . This stores the number that comes right after num. Insert a third Assignment frame. For the identifier, type previous and for the value, type num - 1 . This stores the number just before num. Add a Function Call frame to print (or display) the next number. Add another Function Call frame to print (or display) the previous number. Now test your program by running it with different starting numbers and check that the results make sense. Take a screenshot and add it to your Google doc. Change the order of the assignment steps and run the program again. Ask yourself: Did the output change? Why or why not? Be prepared to answer this question when you review your work with the instructional team. Task 4: Total Bill Calculator Your turn to practice, this time with less help. Using the same approach from Task 3, take the flowchart you built for the Total Bill Calculator in the previous lab and translate it into a Strype program. Think back to the steps you’ve already seen, but try to work more independently here. Don't worry if you make mistakes and need to stop and fix them. That's a normal part of learning coding. Using the same approach from Task 3, take the flowchart you built for the Total Bill Calculator in the previous lab ( Problem Solve 3, Problem 3 ) and translate it into a Strype program. This is the problem with cost, tip, and tax 🐣 Build the Strype program step by step, following your flowchart. Remember to clear out the code area to have a fresh canvas. Run the program with different numbers to make sure the output is correct. Take a screenshot of your finished program and add it to the your Google Doc. Deliverables Make sure your screenshots clearly show both the program and the output. Credit for this assignment is earned by completing a review with a member of the instructional team. Prepare for your review by practicing how you will show that your programs worked. You should be able to “walk through” the programs. During the review you are expected to: Use correct terminology (input, process, output, decision, etc.). Describe the steps you took and the choices you made while solving each problem. Demonstrate reflective thinking about your design and problem-solving approach. To facilitate the review, download a copy of your Google Doc file as a PDF Document (.pdf) and submit it for this assignment. How to Submit Upload the PDF file to Gradescope. Knowledge Check The output you see on the screen is the computer’s way of “talking back” to you. It’s how it shows the result of following your instructions. Quotes matter! They tell the computer whether something is text or a value/command. Translating a flowchart into code is an important step, you’re moving from planning to actually building. input() pauses the program and waits for you to type something, while int(input()) makes sure the input is treated as a number. Running your program with different numbers helps you test and verify that it works correctly. Small changes, like switching the order of steps, can affect the output since programs follow instructions exactly as written	\N	f	f	\N	252047	202580-Fall 2025-ITSC-1212_Combined

92	2680540	Lab: Problem Solve 8	ITSC 1212 Problem Solve 8 Overview and Instructions Overview In this activity we will continue learning how to talk to the computer clearly and connect code to the basic actions a computer can perform. The goal is to see how Python behaves when you type code directly versus when you run a script. You’ll experiment with expressions, statements, variables, strings, arithmetic, and type conversions. Along the way, you’ll notice when Python shows results automatically and when you need to use print(...). Instructions Preliminaries Start IDLE to complete the tasks in this activity: Windows Search your Start Menu for IDLE (Python 3.x) and open it. Mac Open IDLE from Applications → Python 3.x. Linux Type idle3 in a Terminal, or look in your applications menu for IDLE. When IDLE starts, you’ll see the Python Shell window with the prompt: Links to an external site. Using this Google Doc template compile your solutions in a single document to submit for this lab.  You can add images (screenshot, scan, picture). If you are submitting a picture of a pen an paper drawing make sure it is legible. Download the file as a PDF Document (.pdf) and submit for this assignment. Task 1 In the IDLE Shell, typing an expression like a + b automatically displays the result (for example, 8 if a = 3 and b = 5). In contrast, In the IDLE Shell, when you type an expression (like a + b), Python automatically evaluates it and shows the result. Example: >> a = 3\n>>> b = 5\n>>> a + b      # shows 8 in IDLE Shell\n8\n>>> print(a + b)  # works everywhere\n8 The result 8 appears because the IDLE displays the value of expressions. In contrast, when you run a script (a .py file, e.g., test1.py), expressions are still evaluated internally but their results are not shown unless you explicitly use print(...). Example inside a file: a = 3 b = 5 a + b        # evaluated but not displayed print(a + b) # visible output when script runs Your task: At the IDLE prompt, type: >>> 5 * 2 Create a new script file called test1.py. In the file, write only this line: 5 * 2 Save and run the file. Add this line to the same file: print(5 * 2) Save and run the file again. Take a screenshot showing your file and its outputs from both runs. Insert the screenshot into your Google Doc. Task 2 Strings use single or double quotes. >>> print("The quick brown fox")\n>>> print("21 - 18") Concatenation with + : >>> print("The quick" + " brown fox") Space is literal, you must add it yourself if you want it part of the text. Python does not auto-convert numbers to strings: >>> print("The total is " + 13 + 5)\n# TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str You have to explicitly ask it to do the conversion. Do this instead: >>> print("The total is " + str(13 + 5)) Your task: At the IDLE prompt, write a Python expression that prints your name and your favorite food on the same line. Include the code and the output. Write a Python expression that produces the exact output: My total is 42 Try running this line: print ( "The answer is " + 42 ) Then write the corrected version of the code. Take a screenshot of your IDLE window showing your interaction and outputs and add it to your Google Doc. Task 3 Like algebra: parentheses first; then * / / / // / % ; then + / - ; left-to-right as needed. >>> print(5 * (6 - 2))\n>>> print((5 * 6) - 2)\n>>> print(5 * 6 - 2)\n>>> print(5 * (6 - 2)\n# SyntaxError: '(' was never closed Tip: Always close parentheses. Many editors highlight matching pairs. Your tasks: Predict the result of 10 - 3 * 2 (without running it). Write down your prediction. At the IDLE prompt, type the same expression and record the actual result. Rewrite the same expression using parentheses so that the result is 14. Record your code and output. Take a screenshot of your IDLE window showing your interaction and outputs and add it to your Google Doc. Task 4 A literal is a fixed value ( 42 , "Sam" , 3.14 , True ). >>> 42\n>>> "Sam"\n>>> True A variable is a named reference that can change. >>> a = 1\n>>> c = a + 5\n>>> print(c) Update a variable: >>> b = 2\n>>> print(a + b)\n3\n>>> b = 5\n>>> print(a + b)\n6 Your tasks: At the IDLE prompt, assign a variable x = 10 . Then update it using x = x + 5 . Record the final value of x . Create a constant PI = 3.14159 . Use it to calculate the circumference of a circle with radius 4. Show your formula and your code. As a reminder the formula to calculate the circumference of a circle is c = 2 πr . Try to create a variable with an invalid name (e.g., 2bad = 5 ). Take a screenshot of your IDLE window showing your interaction, output and the error message from the previous step and add it to your Google Doc. Note #1 : In programming, a constant is simply a variable that you intend not to change once it’s given a value. Unlike some languages (like Java’s final), Python does not enforce this rule, there’s no built-in way to stop you from reassigning a constant. Instead, programmers follow a naming convention: constants are written in ALL_CAPS with underscores between words, such as: >>> PI = 3.14159 >>> DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7 >>> TAX_RATE = 0.08 This signals to others (and reminds you) that the value should stay fixed. Note #2: Naming rules & conventions (Python) Start with a letter or underscore; then letters, digits, underscores. Case-sensitive; cannot use keywords (e.g., for , if , class ). Style (PEP 8): snake_case for variables ( hours_worked ), UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants ( DAYS_IN_WEEK ). Task 5 Casting (type conversion) Use constructors: int(x) → integer (truncates toward zero ) float(x) → float str(x) → string bool(x) → boolean truthiness >> print(7.3)\n>>> print(int(7.3))          # 7\n>>> print(7.3 * 2.5)\n>>> print(int(7.3) * 2.5)    # int first, then multiply\n>>> print(int(7.3 * 2.5))    # multiply first, then int() Remember to use round(x, ndigits) if you want rounding instead of truncation. Your tasks: At the IDLE prompt, convert the string "123" into an integer, add 10 to it, and show the result. Convert the number 3.14159 to an integer, and then convert it to a string. Run round(7.3 * 2.5, 2) and compare it to int(7.3 * 2.5) . Record both results and explain the difference. Run bool(0) and bool(123) . Record the results. Take a screenshot of your IDLE window showing your interaction, output and describe what you notice about 0 vs. non-zero numbers in the previous step and add it to your Google Doc. Task 6 The input() function lets your program ask the user for information. It always returns a string, even if the user types numbers. Example: >>> name = input("What is your name? ") >>> print("Hello, " + name + "!") Your tasks: Create a new Python file and name it as user_profile.py In this file write an algorithm that does the following: Ask the user for their favorite color and print a message like: Your favorite color is blue. if the user entered "blue" Ask the user for their age and print a message that shows what their age will be in 5 years. For example, if the user enters 20, the program should print In 5 years, you will be 25 years old. Remember to use int() to convert the input string to a number before adding 5. age = int(input("What is your age?") Experiment by running your code: type something that’s letters not an integer number for age (like "hello"). type something that’s a float number not an integer number for age (like 2.45). What happens when you enter a letters (like "hello") and decimals (like 2.45) instead of a whole number for age? Why do you think Python reacted that way? How could you modify your program so it can accept and correctly handle decimal values? Take a screenshot showing your file and its outputs from several runs. Insert the screenshot into your Google Doc Deliverables Credit for this assignment is earned by completing and documenting the tasks in the Google Doc, and by reviewing your work with a member of the instructional team. Before your review practice showing that your code works and be ready to explain what each line does and how it maps to computer actions. During the review you are expected to: Use correct terminology (input, process, output, decision, etc.). Describe the steps you took and the choices you made while solving each problem. Demonstrate reflective thinking about your design and problem-solving approach. To facilitate the review, download a copy of your Google Doc file as a PDF Document (.pdf) and submit it for this assignment. Reminder: The goal of the review is not just to show your answers, but to demonstrate your understanding of how and why your flowcharts solve the problems. How to Submit Upload the PDF file to Gradescope. Knowledge Check I n the IDLE, typing an expression (like 3 + 4) automatically shows the result. In a script (.py file), results are hidden unless you use print(...) to display them. Expressions create values (e.g., a + b), while statements tell the computer to do something (e.g., a = 3). Strings can be combined with +, but f-strings are the easiest and clearest way to mix text and numbers. Arithmetic follows the same rules as math: parentheses first, then multiplication/division, then addition/subtraction. Variables can be updated as your program runs; constants (ALL_CAPS) are values you don’t plan to change. Type conversion functions (int(), float(), str(), bool()) let you safely change between number, text, and truth values. Remember: int() truncates decimals, while round() actually rounds. Use input() to collect information from the user and handle it properly (remember: input is always a string, so convert if you need a number). Errors like SyntaxError or TypeError are helpful. Read them carefully to understand what went wrong. Every line of code maps to the basic computer actions: store data --> process it --> produce output.	\N	f	f	\N	252047	202580-Fall 2025-ITSC-1212_Combined
94	2680669	Lab: Problem Solve 9	ITSC 1212 Problem Solve 9 Overview and Instructions Overview In this activity, you will practice turning algorithms into working Python programs. You’ll start with flowcharts that describe the problem, then translate them into code using input, output, and computation. You’ll experiment with different types of data (numbers, strings), and use Python’s operators and functions to solve simple problems. Instructions Preliminaries Start IDLE to complete the tasks in this activity: Windows Search your Start Menu for IDLE (Python 3.x) and open it. Mac Open IDLE from Applications → Python 3.x. Linux Type idle3 in a Terminal, or look in your applications menu for IDLE. When IDLE starts, you’ll see the Python Shell window with the prompt: Links to an external site. Using this Google Doc template compile your solutions in a single document to submit for this lab.  You can add images (screenshot, scan, picture). If you are submitting a picture of a pen an paper drawing make sure it is legible. Download the file as a PDF Document (.pdf) and submit for this assignment. Task 1 This flowchart shows an algorithm that asks the user for the base and height of a right-angled triangle, then prints the area. Your tasks: At the IDLE prompt, type the following statements one by one to implement the algorithm: base = float(input("Enter the base: ")) height = float(input("Enter the height: ")) area = 0.5 * base * height print("The area is", area) Try it with at least two different sets of numbers. Notice that each time you want to test new values, you must re-enter the statements. Create a new script file called triangle_area.py . Copy the same statements into the file. Save the file. Run the file multiple times, entering different base and height values when prompted. Take a screenshot of at least two runs with different inputs and outputs in your Google Doc and in your own words explain why it’s easier to test multiple cases using a script instead of typing the same statements repeatedly using the IDLE prompt. Task 2 In this task we'll practice with integer division and the modulus operator. Remember to pay attention to data types and perform the necessary conversions. At the IDLE prompt add statements to do the following: Read two integers from the user. Use integer division ( // ) to calculate the quotient. Use the modulus operator ( % ) to calculate the remainder. Print both results. Take a screenshot of your IDLE window showing your interactions and outputs and add it to your Google Doc. Task 3 In this task we'll practice with the len() function At the IDLE prompt add statements to do the following: Ask the user for their name. Use len() to find how many letters are in their name. Multiply that number by 2 and display the result: Your name has 5 letters, and twice that is 10 Take a screenshot of your IDLE window showing your interactions and outputs and add it to your Google Doc. Task 4 At this stage in the course the overall learning target is to be able to design an algorithm that utilizes input, output, and computation actions and be able to translate it to a program. ☺️ We want to design a program that divides apples evenly among teachers and shows how many are left in the basket. Your tasks: Draw a flowchart for the problem: Read the number of teachers and the number of apples from the user. Divide the apples evenly among the teachers. Calculate how many apples remain in the basket. Display both the number of apples each teacher gets and the remainder. Example: If there are 3 teachers and 10 apples, the algorithm should show that each teacher gets 3 apples and 1 apple is left over. Translate your flowchart into Python code by creating a new file named apple_distribution.py . Print both results in a clear message. Test your program by running it several times with different input values, such as: 3 teachers and 10 apples 4 teachers and 25 apples Take a screenshot of your IDLE window showing your file and outputs and add it to your Google Doc along with your flowchart. Task 5 We want to design a program for a text message cost calculator. Your tasks: Draw a flowchart for the problem Ask the user to enter a short message (a string). Use the number of characters in the message to determine the cost of sending it, assuming each character costs 5 cents. Display the total cost back to the user. Translate your flowchart into Python code by creating a new file named message_cost.py Run your program several times, trying out different messages. Test with short, long, and even empty messages to see how the program responds Take a screenshot of your IDLE window showing your file and outputs and add it to your Google Doc along with your flowchart. Deliverables Credit for this assignment is earned by completing and documenting the tasks in the Google Doc, and by reviewing your work with a member of the instructional team. Before your review practice showing that your code works and be ready to explain what each line does and how it maps to computer actions. During the review you are expected to: Use correct terminology (input, process, output, decision, etc.). Describe the steps you took and the choices you made while solving each problem. Demonstrate reflective thinking about your design and problem-solving approach. To facilitate the review, download a copy of your Google Doc file as a PDF Document (.pdf) and submit it for this assignment. Reminder: The goal of the review is not just to show your answers, but to demonstrate your understanding of how and why your flowcharts solve the problems. How to Submit Upload the PDF file to Gradescope. Knowledge Check Flowcharts help outline the logic of a problem. Translating them into Python strengthens your understanding of input, processing, and output. The IDLE shell is good for quick tests, but script files are easier for running programs multiple times and reusing code. User input is always a string. You need to convert it to the right type (int, float, etc.) before doing calculations. Python provides powerful tools like integer division ( // ), modulus ( % ), and built-in functions ( len() ) that simplify common tasks. Running your code with different inputs (including edge cases like empty strings or small numbers) helps confirm that your algorithm and program behave as expected. Program  often combine input, computation, and output. Thinking in terms of these building blocks prepares you to tackle more complex problems.	\N	f	f	\N	252047	202580-Fall 2025-ITSC-1212_Combined

The minimum word count is 500 words, but you may certainly write more than that. QUESTION: How did Native Americans' definitions of freedom, equality, and power differ from those of the wealthy white men who authored our founding documents? How did Native Americans use the language of those documents to advocate for their rights? MATERIALS: You must bring a laptop, and you may bring a 3x5 in notecard Your notecard MUST be an actual notecard, not a creatively-folded scrap of paper. You can get notecards at literally any general store (Target, Walmart, dollar store), at the campus bookstore, or online from Amazon. You may also get one from me if you need Your notecard must be hand-written by you and may not include a pre-written essay. You may, however, include any information that you think will be helpful, including your thesis statement and an outline. GRADING CRITERIA: Thesis Statement: 25 pts The first two sentences of your paper should be your thesis statement (one sentence per question). Your thesis statement should clearly define the rest of your essay and be on topic. Document Use: 25 pts You should use at least one document per unit (4 minimum) to support your thesis statement. You do not need to cite formally, but should name each document that you use. Factually Accurate: 20 The information you include should be accurate according to what we have discussed in class (this means your notes will be a better resource than the internet :) ) There is some leeway on dates (plus or minus a few years), but be as accurate as possible. Well-Structured: 20 Your organization should make sense and be easy to follow. I highly recommend separating your thoughts into multiple paragraphs, but it is not a technical requirement.

54	2652308	Lab: Problem Solve 6	ITSC 1212 Problem Solve 6 Overview and Instructions Overview In this lab, you’ll practice designing algorithms that repeat actions until a goal is reached. The focus is on iteration: the process of executing the same steps multiple times, either for a fixed number of repetitions or until a condition is satisfied. Flowcharts will help you visualize these repeating steps before writing any code. By laying out decisions, loops, and outputs in a diagram, you’ll gain a clearer sense of how your algorithm moves from start to finish. As you work through the problems: Identify where repetition is needed in the solution. Decide how the loop ends (count-controlled vs. condition-controlled). Show these loops explicitly in your flowcharts using the correct symbols. Instructions Preliminaries In this activity, you will practice problem solving using the Input → Process → Output (IPO) model, and then represent your solution as a flowchart . For each of the following problems your task is to design the algorithm and outline the step by step plan to solve the problem. Read each problem carefully. Identify the Input(s) : the information the problem gives you or that the user provides. Identify the Process(es) : the steps or calculations needed to solve the problem. Identify the Output(s) : the final answer, result, or message that should be displayed. Write your answers in the blanks provided for each problem. Using your IPO chart, create a flowchart that shows the sequence of steps for the problem. Use an oval for Start/End. Use a parallelogram for Input and Output. Use a rectangle for Processes (calculations, steps). Use a diamond for Decisions (true/false questions). Label each step in your flowchart with the computer action(s) involved (Remember/Storage, Choose/Decision, Repeat/Iteration, Talk/Output, Listen/Input, Ask for Help/Calling, Calculate/Compute). Check: Does your flowchart show all the inputs, processes, and outputs from your IPO analysis? Tip: Think of IPO as your outline, and the flowchart as the picture of your solution. Refer to these slides for an overview of flowcharts. You can use pen and paper to draw the flowcharts or use any digital tool such as this Google slides template , or draw.io ( visit this page to learn more about how to use this free web-based application for creating flowcharts ). Links to an external site. Using this Google Doc template compile your solutions in a single document to submit for this lab.  You can add images (screenshot, scan, picture). If you are submitting a picture of a pen an paper drawing make sure it is legible. Download the file as a PDF Document (.pdf) and submit for this assignment. Task 1 Design a flowchart for a program that asks the user to enter product ratings from 1–5. The user can keep entering ratings until they type 0 to stop. At the end, the program should calculate and display the average rating. Take a screenshot of your completed flowchart and add it to your Google Doc. Task 2 Design a flowchart for a program that gives the user up to three chances to enter the correct password. Assume the correct password is already stored in the program with the label secret The program should ask the user to enter a password. If the entered password matches the stored password, the program immediately prints “Access granted” and ends. If the entered password does not match, the user is allowed to try again and up to three attempts in total. If the user fails to enter the correct password after three attempts, the program prints “Account locked” and ends. Take a screenshot of your completed flowchart and add it to your Google Doc. Task 3 In this task you are asked to convert the algorithm you came up with for Task 1 to a program using Strype. Go to https://strype.org Links to an external site.. . In your browser, click "Start coding now!" to launch the Strype frame-based editor. Once inside the editor, delete all existing frames so you have a completely empty workspace and a blank canvas to work with. Using the algorithm you designed in Task 1,  implement it step by step by adding the appropriate frames in Strype. Remember that each frame corresponds to a single programming statement or block. Hints: Remember the two types of loops from the prep work: count-controlled loops (repeat a set number of times) and condition-controlled loops (repeat until something changes). In this problem, the program keeps running as long as the rating is not 0. That means you’ll want to use a while loop.🐣 In programming, we use a special operators to mean "equal to" and “not equal to.” The symbol is == (read as “equal to”). The symbol is != (read as “not equal”). Example: x == 5  checks if x is equal to 5 x != 5 checks if x is not equal to 5 So in our problem, if the user types 3, the condition is true (the loop continues). If the user types 0, the condition is false (the loop stops). Once you have implemented all the necessary frames, run the program multiple times. Try different rating values (or input values) to ensure your algorithm's logic behaves exactly as intended. Did everything work as intended? If not, what went wrong? Were there missing frames, logic errors, or unexpected behaviors? What does your program output if the user enters 0 as the first rating value? Take a screenshot that shows both your program (the frames) and the console output. Add your screenshot to your Google Doc and answer the two questions in your document. Deliverables Credit for this assignment is earned by completing and documenting the tasks in the Google Doc, and by reviewing your work with a member of the instructional team. Prepare for your review by practicing how you will show that your flowchart works. You should be able to “walk through” your flowchart step by step and explain how the solution is produced and how each step maps to computer actions. During the review you are expected to: Use correct terminology (input, process, output, decision, etc.). Describe the steps you took and the choices you made while solving each problem. Demonstrate reflective thinking about your design and problem-solving approach. To facilitate the review, download a copy of your Google Doc file as a PDF Document (.pdf) and submit it for this assignment. Reminder: The goal of the review is not just to show your answers, but to demonstrate your understanding of how and why your flowcharts solve the problems. How to Submit Upload the PDF file to Gradescope. Knowledge Check Design first! Visualizing the logic before coding helps you plan clearly and avoid mistakes. Every step in your algorithm becomes a specific instruction in your program. Input/output, conditionals, and loops are core logic structures in almost every program you will write. Special inputs (like 0) can signal when to stop a loop. Test your program using different kinds of inputs, including unusual or edge cases, to make sure it behaves as expected. If you see errors or results that don’t match what you planned, that’s a sign your logic needs adjustment	\N	f	f	\N	252047	202580-Fall 2025-ITSC-1212_Combined

79	2671601	Lab: Problem Solve 5	ITSC 1212 Problem Solve 5 Overview and Instructions Overview In this lab, you’ll practice designing algorithms that make decisions. The focus is on conditionals—the process of choosing one path of action when a condition is true and a different path when it is false. Flowcharts will help you visualize these decision points before you write any code. By laying out conditions, possible outcomes, and actions in a diagram, you can clearly see how the program responds to different situations. As you work through the problems: Identify where a decision needs to be made in the solution. Express the condition clearly in your flowchart (e.g., is the number even? did the user enter the correct password?). Show the branches that follow from “Yes” and “No.” Your goal is not only to solve the problems but also to communicate the decision-making process clearly through structured diagrams. A clear flowchart makes it much easier to later translate your design into code with if, elif, and else statements. Refer to the resources shared in Module 3: Learning Guide if you need a refresher on these topics. Instructions Preliminaries In this activity, you will practice problem solving using the Input → Process → Output (IPO) model, and then represent your solution as a flowchart . For each of the following problems your task is to design the algorithm and outline the step by step plan to solve the problem. Read each problem carefully. Identify the Input(s) : the information the problem gives you or that the user provides. Identify the Process(es) : the steps or calculations needed to solve the problem. Identify the Output(s) : the final answer, result, or message that should be displayed. Write your answers in the blanks provided for each problem. Using your IPO chart, create a flowchart that shows the sequence of steps for the problem. Use an oval for Start/End. Use a parallelogram for Input and Output. Use a rectangle for Processes (calculations, steps). Use a diamond for Decisions (true/false questions). Label each step in your flowchart with the computer action(s) involved (Remember/Storage, Choose/Decision, Repeat/Iteration, Talk/Output, Listen/Input, Ask for Help/Calling, Calculate/Compute). Check: Does your flowchart show all the inputs, processes, and outputs from your IPO analysis? Tip: Think of IPO as your outline, and the flowchart as the picture of your solution. Refer to these slides for an overview of flowcharts. You can use pen and paper to draw the flowcharts or use any digital tool such as this Google slides template , or draw.io ( visit this page to learn more about how to use this free web-based application for creating flowcharts ). Links to an external site. Using this Google Doc template compile your solutions in a single document to submit for this lab.  You can add images (screenshot, scan, picture). If you are submitting a picture of a pen an paper drawing make sure it is legible. Download the file as a PDF Document (.pdf) and submit for this assignment. Navigating between different tools can be overwhelming when you first use them. If you are not sure how to navigate any of these tools check with a TA, Task 1 Design an algorithm that asks a user to enter a rating from 1–5. If the rating is 5, the program outputs: “Thank you for the great review!” Otherwise, the program outputs: “Thanks for your feedback.” Your tasks Define the Input, Process, and Output (IPO) for this problem. Draw the flowchart that represents your algorithm using correct flowchart symbols. Label each step in your flowchart with the computer action involved. Take a screenshot of your completed flowchart and add it to your Google Doc. Task 2 Design an algorithm that asks the user to enter a number. If the number is zero, the program outputs: “The number is zero.” If the number is positive, the program outputs: “The number is positive.” Otherwise, the program outputs: “The number is negative.” Your tasks Define the Input, Process, and Output (IPO) for this problem. Draw the flowchart that represents your algorithm using correct flowchart symbols. Label each step in your flowchart with the computer action involved. Take a screenshot of your completed flowchart and add it to your Google Doc. Task 3 Women’s Olympic boxing (2020 Tokyo Games) is divided into five weight classes: Flyweight: up to 112 lbs (51 kg) Featherweight: up to 126 lbs (57 kg) Lightweight: up to 132 lbs (60 kg) Welterweight: up to 152 lbs (69 kg) Middleweight: up to 165 lbs (75 kg) Design an algorithm that accepts a positive number representing a boxer’s weight (in pounds). The algorithm should determine the boxer’s weight class based on the ranges above and print a message with the assigned class. Your tasks Define the Input, Process, and Output (IPO) for this problem. Draw the flowchart that represents your algorithm using correct flowchart symbols. Label each step in your flowchart with the computer action involved. Take a screenshot of your completed flowchart and add it to your Google Doc. Task 4 Go to https://strype.org Links to an external site. in your browser and click "Start coding now!" Begin by deleting the existing frames so that you start with an empty program. In this program we will put together a program that checks whether a person is an adult or not based on their age. This is flowchart for an algorithm that accomplishes this task Add an assignment with an input function frame and convert to int : Add an if frame and nest a print function frame inside it: Add an else frame and nest a print function frame: Run the program with values below and above 18 and compare outputs. Run your program at least twice using different numbers and verify that the output is correct. Take a screenshot of the two program runs and add it to your Google Doc. Deliverables Credit for this assignment is earned by completing and documenting the tasks in the Google Doc, and by reviewing your work with a member of the instructional team.

Process = the steps/calculations/decisions performed on the input. Output = the result shown to the user. IPO helps you plan your algorithm before coding. An if statement checks a condition and chooses what action to take. if/else handles two outcomes. Use this when there are exactly two possibilities (e.g., pass/fail, even/odd, 5-star vs. not 5-star). if/else if /else handles multiple outcomes. Use this when you need to cover more than two categories (e.g., positive/negative/zero, 1–5 ratings with different messages). Conditions must be mutually exclusive. Only one branch will run, and once a condition is true, the rest are skipped. Each decision creates a branch in the diagram; binary decisions have two paths, multi-branch decisions extend this idea.	\N	f	f	\N	252047	202580-Fall 2025-ITSC-1212_Combined

86	2677537	Lab: Problem Solve 7	ITSC 1212 Problem Solve 7 Overview and Instructions Overview This activity is designed to to give you hands-on practice with Python by solving small problems step by step. You’ll learn how to use the Python IDLE Shell as a way to give your computer instructions directly. You will practice typing in commands and immediately see the results. As you practice, you’ll see how simple expressions and function calls map onto the kinds of actions computers perform for us every day. Instructions Preliminaries The first thing we need to do is get your environment ready. This section will guide you through installing Python, starting IDLE on your computer, and running a few simple commands. Think of this as warming up and making sure your tools are ready so you can focus on problem solving in the rest of the lab. This activity requires you to run Python using IDLE on your computer Follow the instructions on this page to Install Python and IDLE. Starting IDLE Windows Search your Start Menu for IDLE (Python 3.x) and open it. Mac Open IDLE from Applications → Python 3.x. Linux Type idle3 in a Terminal, or look in your applications menu for IDLE. When IDLE starts, you’ll see the Python Shell window with the prompt: At the >>> prompt, type Python code and press enter/return : >>> 3 + 4 7 >>> "hello".upper() 'HELLO' To end the session close the window or type: >>> exit() Your session ends, but you can reopen IDLE anytime. Links to an external site. Using this Google Doc template compile your solutions (screenshots and answers) in a single document to submit for this assignment. Task 1 Integers are whole numbers (…, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, …). Try these: >>> 6 + 9\n>>> 125 // 3     # integer (floor) division\n>>> 200 - 11\n>>> 18 * 4\n>>> 9 % 4        # the remainder In Python 3, / is true division (returns a float), while // is floor division (integer if both operands are ints). Example: 125 / 3 → 41.666… (float), but 125 // 3 → 41 . Take a screenshot and add to your Google Doc and answer the following questions: Why does 125 / 3 give a different result from 125 // 3 ? In what situations might you choose to use floor division ( // ) instead of regular division ( / )? Task 2 Floats represent real numbers (with decimals). If any operand is a float, the result is a float. For example, 18 * 4.0 produces 72.0 . Try: >>> 12.5 + 9.7\n>>> 208.4 / 4.1\n>>> 284.759 - 11.603\n>>> 18.1 * 4\n>>> 18 * 4.1\n>>> 18.0 * 4.0 Take a screenshot and add to your Google Doc and answer the following questions: What happens when you mix integers and floats in the same calculation? Why do you think Python shows .0 at the end of results like 72.0 ? Task 3 Booleans are True or False . Try: >>> print(2 > 3)\n>>> print(5 == 5)\n>>> print(7 <= 5)\n>>> print('a' < 'b')\n>>> print(12 != 7) == tests equality (not the same as = assignment). Characters in Python are strings of length 1 ; comparing 'a' < 'b' uses Unicode (an encoding standard like ASCII) order. Take a screenshot and add to your Google Doc and answer the following questions: Which of the comparison operators (==, <, >, etc.) did you find most intuitive? Which was least? How might boolean expressions help a program make decisions? Task 4 Like algebra: parentheses first; then * / / / // / % ; then + / - ; left-to-right as needed. >>> 5 * (6 - 2)\n>>> (5 * 6) - 2\n>>> 5 * 6 - 2\n>>> 5 * (6 - 2\n# SyntaxError: '(' was never closed Tip: Always close parentheses. Many editors highlight matching pairs. Take a screenshot and add to your Google Doc and answer the following questions: Were the results always what you predicted? If not, what surprised you? How does the use of parentheses help make expressions clearer to both Python and humans? Task 5 So far, you’ve been typing individual expressions into the Shell. Python also lets you call functions, which are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific job. Try these built-in function calls in IDLE. Predict what each one will return before pressing Enter: >>> abs(-15)                      # abs(x): returns the absolute value of x >>> round(3.14159, 2)             # round(x, n): rounds x to n decimal places (default is 0) >>> len("The quick brown fox")    # len(s): returns the number of items in s (characters in a string) Now experiment by calling each function with different arguments. Try abs(10) and abs(-1234) . Round 3.14159 to 0 , 1 , 3 , or 5 decimal places. Measure the length of "hello" , "flowcharts are cool", or even an empty string "" or one with a space " " . Take a screenshot showing your experimentation and add it your Google Doc.

Knowledge Check Python data types: int , float , bool , str (single characters are strings of length 1) Python uses arithmetic ( + , - , * , / , // , % , ** ) and relational ( < , > , == , != , <= , >= ) operators. Complex expressions follow the standard order of operations (parentheses first, then multiplication/division, then addition/subtraction, left-to-right). How Python evaluates complex expressions (order of operations; parentheses) An expression produces a value (e.g., 3 + 5 , a > b ) while statements performs an action (e.g., x = 10 , print(x) , len("Tyrannosaurus") ).	\N	f	f	\N	252047	202580-Fall 2025-ITSC-1212_Combined

99	2685829	Lab: Problem Solve 10	ITSC 1212 Problem Solve 10 Overview and Instructions Overview The goal for this lab is to practice identifying and correcting errors in programs as well as defining our own functions. Refer to the resources shared in Module 6: Learning Guide - Fixing Errors and Reusing Solutions if you need a refresher on these topics. Instructions Preliminaries Start IDLE to complete the tasks in this activity: Windows Search your Start Menu for IDLE (Python 3.x) and open it. Mac Open IDLE from Applications → Python 3.x. Linux Type idle3 in a Terminal, or look in your applications menu for IDLE. When IDLE starts, you’ll see the Python Shell window with the prompt: Links to an external site.

If you are submitting a picture of a pen an paper drawing make sure it is legible. Download the file as a PDF Document (.pdf) and submit for this assignment. Task 1 Given the following flowchart of an algorithm to determine whether a number n is positive, negative or equals to zero. The algorithm is problematic. What is wrong with this flowchart? What type of error does this issue illustrate? Take a screenshot of the corrected flowchart and insert it into your Google Doc along with your answers to the questions above. Task 2 The following Python statement is intended to output “Welcome to ITSC 1212!” but it has some errors. Identify the problems and fix them. primt 'Welcome to ITSC 1212!" What is wrong with this code? When you run it in IDLE, what error message do you get, and why? Write the correct version of the code. Take a screenshot of your IDLE window showing your interaction and outputs and add it to your Google Doc along with your answers to the questions above. Task 3 Consider the following code. The program is supposed to take the user’s current age and calculate what the age will be in 8 years. age = input ( "How old are you? " ) age + 8 print ( "You will be " + age + " in 8 years" ) Your tasks: Copy the code into a new Python file and run it. What goes wrong? When you run it in IDLE, what error message do you see? Why does this error occur? Update the code so that it runs correctly and produces the intended output. Take a screenshot showing your file and its outputs and outputs and add it to your Google Doc along with your answers to the questions above. Task 4 Consider the following code dog year = input ( 'Please provide your dog' s age : ') to human = dog year * 7 print ( Your dog 's age is equivalent to" to human, human years ) We want the user to enter the age of their dog and we want to write a program that will output the age of the dog in human years. The rule you want your program to follow is that 1 dog year is 7 human years. We wrote some code for you, but it has some errors. Fix the code to give you the expected result every time, with any valid number value the user specifies. For example, if my dog is 7 years old, I expect to see the following output: Your dog’s age is equivalent to 49 human years. Copy the code into a new Python file and run it. What goes wrong? When you run it in IDLE, what error message do you see? Why does this error occur? Update the code so that it runs correctly and produces the intended output. Take a screenshot of your IDLE window showing your interaction, output and the error message from the previous step and add it to your Google Doc. Task 5 Consider the following code,  that takes two numbers and calculates the average. Before running it try to do it on a paper and use a calculator. What is the average of two numbers like: 7 and 9? Now, run the program with these numbers. Do you get the result you expected? Obviously, the result is wrong, but Python is not complaining at all! This is because a logical or semantic mistake has been made. There is nothing wrong with the syntax, but the calculation is wrong. Fix the code to give the expected result every time, with any pair of numbers the user specifies. x = float ( input ( 'Enter a number: ' )) y = float ( input ( 'Enter a number: ' )) z = x + y /2 print ( 'The average of the two numbers you have entered is:' , z ) Copy the code into a new Python file and run it. Did Python give you any error messages? Is the output correct? If not, explain what is causing the problem? Explain what changes need to be made to make this code behave as expected. Update the code so that it runs correctly and produces the intended output. Take a screenshot of your IDLE window showing your interaction, output and describe what you notice about 0 vs. non-zero numbers in the previous step and add it to your Google Doc. Task 6 In the following program you are given another problematic code that runs but doesn’t give the expected result. The code should prompt the user for two numbers, calculate and display their sum. num = float ( input ( 'Enter a number: ' )) num = float ( input ( 'Enter a number: ' ) sum = num + num print (' The sum of the two numbers you have entered is : ' , sum ) Copy the code into a new Python file and run it. Did Python give you any error messages? Is the output correct? If not, explain what is causing the problem? Explain what changes need to be made to make this code behave as expected. Update the code so that it runs correctly and produces the intended output. Take a screenshot of your IDLE window showing your interaction, output and describe what you notice about 0 vs. non-zero numbers in the previous step and add it to your Google Doc. Task 7 Complete the add_two function so that it prints the sum of its two parameters. def add_two(num1:float, num2:float): # insert your code here Copy the code into a new Python file and write the body of the function so that it prints the sum of num1 and num2. Save the file and then run it to make sure there are no syntax errors and the function is defined. In the IDLE Shell, add at least two test calls to the function (for example, add_two(3, 4) or add_two(1.5, 2.5)) to verify that your code works. Check that the output is correct for both integer and float values. Take a screenshot showing your file and its outputs and add it to your Google Doc. Task 8 Define a Python function named letter_count that takes three parameters. The function expects strings to be passed in as the parameters value. The function should print an integer value that represents the number of characters across the three strings. Implement this function in in a new file and verify that it works as intended by adding statements that include a call to this function. For example, a call like this letter_count("From a programmer’s point of view", "the user is a peripheral", "that types when you issue a read request") would return 97. In a new Python file, define a function that accepts three string arguments and prints the total number of characters contained in all three strings combined Save the file and then run it to make sure there are no syntax errors and the function is defined. In the IDLE Shell add at least two test calls to the function (for example, letter_count("great","day", "today") or letter_count("charlotte", "rocks", "alot")) to verify that your code works. Take a screenshot showing your file and its outputs and add it to your Google Doc.

105	2686285	Lab: Problem Solve 14	ITSC 1212 Problem Solve 14 Overview and Instructions Overview The goal of this lab is to practice and synthesize what we've learned so far as a review for checkpoint 2. Tasks Instructions: Checkpoint 2 is just around the corner. Use this time to review and practice your skills. Make sure you can: Define a function that takes one or more parameters. Perform computations inside the function using those parameters. Use conditionals (if, if-else) to make decisions. Return a result or print meaningful output. In other words, you should be comfortable writing a function that solves a problem, performs a calculation, and adapts its behavior based on different inputs. For this lab, you have two paths to choose from: 🔁 Reinforce Practice problems similar in scope and style to previous labs. Choose this option if you’re still working on connecting the concepts we’ve covered and want more guided practice before Checkpoint 2. You can always return later to try the Extend option. 🚀 Extend Tackle a more open-ended problem that combines multiple concepts introduced so far. Choose this path if you’re caught up, confident in your understanding, and ready to stretch your skills as you prepare for Checkpoint 2. Regardless of which option you choose it is important to practice good programming habits: Use descriptive, meaningful names for variables and functions. Clear names make your code easier to read and understand. Document your work using comments and docstrings for each function. Include short explanations of what the function does, its parameters, and what it returns. Think modularly. Break your solution into smaller, reusable “IPO machines” (Input → Process → Output). Each function should have a single, clear purpose. Use type annotations for all function parameters and return values. This makes your code more readable and helps others (and tools) understand how it works. Test and verify your programs to ensure the output matches what you expect. Don’t just assume it works. Run it, check it, and fix it if needed. 🔁 Reinforce Links to an external site. Use the Practice Zone workspace on Runestone to strengthen your skills by writing functions that implement each of the following logic. even_or_odd(n) -->Returns "even" if n is even, "odd" otherwise. max_of_two(a, b) --> Returns the larger of two numbers. is_divisible(x, y) --> Returns True if x is divisible by y, otherwise False. sign_of_number(n) --> Prints "positive", "negative", or "zero". temp_converter(temp, scale) --> Converts a temperature between Fahrenheit and Celsius based on the scale parameter ( "F" means input is Fahrenheit, return Celsius; "C" means input is Celsius, return Fahrenheit) discount(price, coupon) --> Applies a discount if a valid coupon code is provided (e.g., "SAVE10"). Note: You will have to decide what a valid coupon code looks like (e.g., is it a specific number, a certain word, a combination of certain letters and numbers) speed_check(speed, limit) --> Prints "Within limit" or "Speeding". If speeding, also print how much over the limit. bmi_category(weight, height) --> Calculates BMI and prints "Underweight", "Normal", "Overweight", or "Obese". Do the research and find out the breakpoints for each BMI classification. tax_calculator(income) --> Uses tiered tax brackets to compute estimated taxes owed. for example: - if income is 10,000 or less -> tax is 10% of total income. - If income is between 10,001 and 30,000 -> tax is: 10% on first 10,000 + 20% on the rest (income - 10,000). - If income is above 30,000 -> tax is: 10% on first 10,000 + 20% on next 20,000 + 30% on remaining (income - 30,000 ) grade_evaluator(score) --> Returns a letter grade (A, B, C, etc.) with a message. You can use our course's grade breakdown as an example for score to letter mapping shipping_cost(weight, expedited) --> Computes shipping based on package weight and whether the user selected expedited delivery. 🚀 Extend Before you start: If you’re all caught up and feeling confident with what we’ve covered so far, try applying your skills to this mini-project challenge activity. You may also want to preview the next module’s prep work to learn about multi-selection and nested conditionals. Concepts you can begin to incorporate as you work through this problem. You can create a new Python file in IDLE (or your preferred IDE) or use one of the active code blocks on this practice zone on Runestone . The Problem! You’re designing a simple command-line “fitness tracker” app that helps users decide what to do based on their activity level, goals, and available time. Requirements: Prompt the user for: Their activity goal (strength, cardio, or flexibility) Minutes available (int) Current weather (sunny, rainy, cold, etc.) Use conditional logic to: Suggest an activity plan based on goal and conditions (e.g., if cardio and sunny → “Go for a run!”). Adjust recommendation for time (e.g., if < 30 minutes → “Try a short HIIT workout”). Handle unexpected input gracefully (invalid goal or weather). Use at least one function, e.g.: def suggest_activity(goal: str, minutes: int, weather: str) -> str: ... Return and print a personalized message: Example output: You chose cardio with 25 minutes on a rainy day. Suggested activity: Indoor cycling or jump rope. Optional enhancements: Include “motivation level” (1-5) as a factor for the user to enter. Add elif chains for more nuanced decision-making. Log recommendations in a list or file. What you are enforcing: Use Boolean logic and compound conditionals to model real-world reasoning. Design reusable functions with parameters and return values. Translate an open-ended problem into a structured algorithm. Demonstrate adaptability and clear computational thinking. Creating scripts with functions that include docstrings and comments. While you are working on this project it is important that you think about "what decisions does your program make and why?” Deliverables We’re leaving this one open for you to decide how you’d like to practice. You can complete just one problem to reinforce your understanding, or go further and try the extended challenge. We're leaving this one open and up to you to decide how to practice. In the input text box, leave a short note indicating which option you chose and how far you've gotten.  Review your work with a TA to receive credit for this activity. There’s no required amount. The goal is simply to practice in the way that helps you learn best.	2025-10-16 10:44:08	f	f	\N	252047	202580-Fall 2025-ITSC-1212_Combined

By now, you’ve likely developed a rhythm for working through each lab, reading the prompt carefully, tracing the example, and then building your own version step by step. This week’s lab builds on that same structure but introduces a new kind of thinking loop, both in code and in your process. Try to notice how the while loop in your program mirrors your own approach to problem solving: you check your progress, make adjustments, and repeat until you get the right result. The more you practice this structured repetition, the more natural it becomes, both for writing code and for debugging it. So as you work, keep that mindset: repeat with purpose, focus on improving each iteration rather than rushing to the end.

Include a docstring for each function that clearly states the Input–Process–Output (IPO). In the last problem solve we provided the IPO descriptions for you. This time you will need to specify them. Look back if you need a refresher. Use type annotations for all function parameters and return values to make your code clearer. Example: def add_tax(price: float, tax_rate: float) -> float: Add 2–3 test calls at the bottom of each file and verify the outputs match your expectations. Task 1 Create a new Python file and name it count_up.py Write a function named count_up(limit) that takes one integer number. The function should  print all numbers from 1 to limit, one per line, followed by "Done!". The function should: Use a while loop to control the logic for displaying the numbers. Include type annotations and a docstring with IPO descriptions. Add a few test calls to check your work. # Example run \n>>> count_up(4) 1 2 3 4 Done! Run the program and confirm that the function returns the correct results. If something doesn’t look right, review your code and fix any issues before moving on. Task 2 Create a new Python file and name it parrot.py Write a function named parrot() that continuously echoes what the user says, just like a parrot, until the user types "quit" . The function should: Use a while loop to keep listening. For empty inputs (pressing Enter with no text) the program should display  "Please say something!" Print "Goodbye!" when done. Add a few test calls to check your work. # Example Run\nSay something (or 'quit' to stop): hello You said: hello Say something (or 'quit' to stop): Please say something! Say something (or 'quit' to stop): python You said: python Say something (or 'quit' to stop): quit Goodbye! Run the program and confirm that the function returns the correct results. If something doesn’t look right, review your code and fix any issues before moving on. Task 3 Click here for a slide version of this task description or proceed with the task description below. Use your existing dice_roll(num) function to simulate a simple dice game that keeps rolling until the player gets a “Lucky roll.” You will create a new function named play_dice_game() that uses a while loop to repeatedly roll the die and display the results. Keep your existing dice_roll(num) function from the previous problem solve. This function should take one integer (1–6) and return one of the following strings: "Low roll" for 1, 2, or 3 "High roll" for 4 or 5 "Lucky roll" for 6 Open your dice_roll.py file Import the random module at the top of your file: import random 🐥  TLDR: The random module lets you generate random numbers in Python, similar to rolling a real die. You’ll use random.randint(1, 6) to simulate a dice roll. In Python, the random module lets us generate random numbers, just like rolling a real die! Before you can use it, you need to import it at the top of your program: import random Once it’s imported, you can use random.randint(a, b) to get a random integer between a and b , including both ends. For example: roll = random.randint(1, 6) print("You rolled:", roll) This line simulates rolling a six-sided die and stores the result in roll . Create the new play_dice_game() new function that: Uses a while loop to keep rolling until "Lucky roll" is returned. Each iteration: Generates a random roll: random.randint(1, 6) Calls dice_roll(roll) to classify the result Prints the roll and a matching message: Low roll --> “Better luck next time!” High roll --> “Nice roll!” Lucky roll --> “Jackpot! You rolled a 6!” Stops the loop when the result is "Lucky roll" and prints “Game over!” Before continuing, call the play_dice_game() function several times to make sure your program behaves as expected. Each time you run it, the function should: Roll the die repeatedly until a 6 (the “Lucky roll”) appears. Display the result of each roll, along with the appropriate message (“Better luck next time!”, “Nice roll!”, or “Jackpot!”). Count the total number of rolls it took to reach the Lucky roll and print that total at the end. You may notice that the number of rolls changes each time...that’s expected! Because the rolls are generated using the random module, your game will produce different outcomes on each run. If you see it looping indefinitely or skipping messages, double-check that your while loop condition and counter variable are placed correctly inside the function. Now modify your play_dice_game() function so it keeps track of how many rolls it takes to get a lucky roll. Add a variable (for example, count = 0 ) before the loop starts to track the number of rolls. Increase the count by one inside the loop each time you roll. After the loop ends, print the total number of rolls it took to win. Run the program and confirm that the function still produces the correct results. Notice that the test calls you wrote earlier for dice_roll(num) and your initial version of play_dice_game() still work the same way. The new code that tracks the number of rolls simply adds more information without changing the game’s behavior. This is a good reminder that when you extend a program by adding features, your existing functionality should continue to work as before. Possible Extension Challenge NOTE: Possible extensions are optional. Tackle them if you are looking for an additional opportunity to practice problem solving. ☺️ Create a second functio n named play_again() that allows the user to play the dice game multiple times. This function should use a while loop to keep calling play_dice_game() until the user decides to stop.

108	2686288	Lab: Problem Solve 17	ITSC 1212 Problem Solve 17 Overview and Instructions Overview For the best results, plan to complete this assignment in lab! 🛑  This activity is designed to be completed during your scheduled lab session with access to the physical micro:bit device and instructor guidance. Supplemental resources and walkthroughs will be provided. If you miss class, you may still attempt the assignment using the Strype interface, but: Some of the programming syntax used in this activity has not been explicitly covered yet, we will go over it together during the lab. Some parts can be simulated digitally. You will not have access to the physical components to test all parts that are required for the full experience. In this activity, you will be moving your Python dice game onto the BBC micro:bit . You’ll shake the device to "roll" a die (1-6), display the result on the LED grid, and show a short message based on the outcome (Low/High/Lucky). Recall that the BBC micro:bit is a small programmable computer designed to make learning coding fun and interactive. In this activity, you will: Write Python programs that use micro:bit hardware features (buttons, LEDs, accelerometer). Display text and graphics. Respond to user input with loops, conditionals, and variables. Reflect on your experience using an API. Tasks Setup: 🐥 (pet me!) Working with the micro:bit adds a whole new layer of creativity. Your code now interacts with the real world! Don’t worry if it feels a little different at first. Try things out, watch how the device responds, and learn by experimenting. Every shake, scroll, or button press helps you understand how input and output connect through code. Open the micro:bit MicroPython editor Rather than using Strype (frame-based), this lab uses a text-based editor that supports the micro:bit. This environment should feel more familiar, as writing code here closely resembles the way you program in IDLE or other standard Python editors. Watch this 1.5 minutes video for a quick tour of the interface. All you need to worry about the code editor in the middle and the right side frame with the built-in micor:bit simulator Name your project microbit_dice If you are working in the lab and have a micro:bit send the sample program to the micro:bit to ensure your micro:bit is connected via USB and recognized by your computer. Step 1 In this step, we will program detecting a shake and displaying a random number (1–6) on the LED grid. Delete the template code keeping the micro:bit import statement. Import the additional library you’ll need: from microbit import * import random Recall from the last time we worked with the micro:bit that programs on the micro:bit run continuously inside a while True loop. Use sleep(ms) when needed to slow down actions so you can see what’s happening and avoid overwhelming the display. Inside a while True loop, check for a shake gesture using: if accelerometer.was_gesture("shake"): When a shake is detected, generate a random number between 1 and 6 using random.randint(1, 6) . Display the number on the LED grid using display.show(str(roll)) . Keep it visible for about one second with sleep(1000) , then clear the screen using display.clear() . Test the program using the built-in simulator. You should see a number between 1-6 appear each time you shake the micro;bit. Now see it working on the actual micro:bit. Connect the micro:bit to your computer and flash the program. Shake the micro:bit. Numbers 1-6 should appear randomly for ~1 second. Shake multiple times and confirm different numbers appear. If messages are too fast, increase the argument used to call the sleep( ) function or let the scroll finish before clearing. If nothing happens, check that your USB cable connection and your device is flashed correctly. Step 2 In this step, we will enhance the program to show a short message based on the roll, then display the number. Add a message (Low/High/Lucky) before showing the number, use if/elif logic to classify the roll: 1–3 --> "Low roll" 4–5 --> "High roll" 6 --> "Lucky roll!" Use display.scroll("message") to show the text message before the number. Then display the rolled number for about 1-2 seconds and clear the screen. Use short pauses ( sleep() ) to make transitions smoother. Test the program using the built-in simulator and confirm the correct message scrolls before the digit. Roll several times. Verify messages align with values (1–3 -> Low, 4–5 -> High, 6 -> Lucky). Now see it working on the actual microbit. Connect the micro:bit to your computer, flash and play with the program. Step 3 In this part, we'll extend our program to track total shakes and use the buttons to show or rest the tracker. At the top of your file, create a variable named count and set it to 0 . Each time the user shakes the micro:bit, increase the counter by 1 using count += 1 . Make sure you add this instruction under the correct code block to avoid a logical error. Use button_b to display the total number of rolls: if button_b.was_pressed():\n    display.scroll(str(count)) Use button_a to reset the counter and confirm with a message: if button_a.was_pressed():\n    count = 0\n    display.scroll("Reset") Be sure to include these checks inside your while True loop so they run continuously. Test the program using the built-in simulator and confirm the buttons work as intended. Shake several times, then press button B, the number of rolls should display. Press button A, the counter should reset to 0 and show "Reset" Now see it working on the actual microbit. Connect the micro:bit to your computer, flash and play with the program. Possible Extension Challenge NOTE: Possible extensions are optional. Tackle them if you are looking for an additional opportunity to practice problem solving. ☺️ Refactor your program to make use of functions. For example adding a dice_roll and play_game functions that make the logic more modular. Show a simple icon for each category (Low, High, Lucky) before the number. You can take advantage of the built-in images in part of the display module . Play a short melody on "Lucky roll!" Explore the sound module for the micro:bit Deliverables Credit for this assignment is earned by completing, submitting your completed tasks and by reviewing your work with a member of the instructional team. Before your review practice showing that your code works and be ready to explain what each line does.

How to Submit Click the three vertical dots on the Save button and click "Save Python script" to download your program. This will add a new file microbit_dice_main.py to your downloads folder. Upload the Python file microbit_dice_main.py of the program you developed to Gradescope. Knowledge Check In this lab you practiced how to: Understand how event-driven programming differs from sequential programs and recognizing that the micro:bit continuously monitors for user actions (gestures, button presses) inside a while True loop. Apply the Input–Process–Output (IPO) model to map how sensor inputs (e.g., accelerometer) trigger processing logic and produce visual or auditory outputs on the LED display or speaker. Combine iteration and conditional logic to control program flow by using loops to continuously check for input and if/elif statements to decide responses. Use variables to persist data across events, such as tracking roll counts or player scores, reinforcing how state is maintained in an interactive system. Interpret and implement hardware I/O functions like was_gesture("shake") , button_a.was_pressed() , and display.scroll() to connect logical program structures to physical device behaviors. Practice incremental testing by verifying each new behavior (shake detection, feedback messages, counters) before integrating them together into a complete, reliable interactive program. Reflect on how incorporating physical inputs and outputs transforms a static computational problem into an interactive system, demonstrating how code responds dynamically to the physical world.	\N	f	f	\N	252047	202580-Fall 2025-ITSC-1212_Combined
109	2686289	Lab: Problem Solve 18	ITSC 1212 Problem Solve 18 Overview and Instructions Overview The goal of this lab is to practice core programming skills for working with sequences (ordered collections of data such as strings, lists, and tuples). You’ll learn how to access individual elements, extract slices, measure sequence length, and use built-in methods to explore and manipulate data. Understanding how sequences work is essential to solving real-world problems in programming. Strings let you process text, lists let you group related items that can change, and tuples let you store fixed sets of values that should not be modified. Through this lab, you’ll apply indexing, slicing, and sequence operations to analyze data and produce meaningful results. Happy coding and learning! Tasks Instructions: 🐥 (pet me!) Remember, the goal isn’t to get everything perfect the first time, it’s to pay attention to what changes and improves each time you test, debug, and refine your code! Programming is about iteration, not instant perfection. Every error message you read, every small adjustment you make, and every "aha" moment you have is part of how you learn to think like a problem solver. So celebrate progress, not perfection. Each time you get your code one step closer to working the way you want, you’re strengthening your understanding and building habits that real programmers use every day. Every small fix truly is a step toward mastery, keep experimenting, stay curious, and trust that you’re getting better with every line of code you write. Make sure to use the suggested filenames. Include a docstring for each function that clearly states the Input–Process–Output (IPO). Use type annotations for all function parameters and return values to make your code clearer. Example: def add_tax(price: float, tax_rate: float) -> float: After you finish writing your programs, take time to test them in different ways, not just with the example inputs, but also with your own variations. Run your program multiple times, try unexpected or edge cases, and verify that the outputs match what you expect to happen. Task 1 Create a new Python file and name it analyze_string.py Your task is to write a program that defines and calls a function named analyze_string(phrase) that displays information about a user-entered phrase. Your program must use indexing [] , slicing [start:end:step] , and len() to complete this task. Define a function analyze_string(phrase: str) that prints: The length of the string. The third character of the string. The second-to-last character of the string. The first five characters of the string. All but the last two characters of the string. Define another function named main() that: Prompts the user for a phrase that is at least 5 characters long. Validates length; if valid, calls analyze_string(phrase) , else prints an error. At the end of your file, simply include a call to main main() Run the program and confirm that the program displays the correct results. If something doesn’t look right, review your code and fix any issues before moving on. Task 2 Create a new Python file and name it describe_cheeses.py Your task is to write a program that defines and calls a function named describe_cheeses(cheeses) that prints details about a list of cheese types. Your program must us e indexing ( cheeses[2] , cheeses[-2] ) and slicing ( cheeses[:-2] ) to complete this task. Define describe_cheeses(cheeses: list[str]) that prints: The list’s length. The third cheese type. The second-to-last cheese type. All but the last two cheese types. The length of the first cheese type Define another function named main() that: Creates a list of at least six cheese names. For example, cheeses = ["Brie", "Cheddar", "Gouda", "Mozzarella", "Parmesan", "Feta"] Calls describe_cheeses() . At the end of your file, include a call to main Run the program and confirm that the program displays the correct results. If something doesn’t look right, review your code and fix any issues before moving on. Task 3 Create a new Python file and name it get_last_two.py Your task is to write a program that defines and calls a function named get_last_two(names) that returns the last and second-to-last elements of a list. Your program must work for any list of two or more elements. Define get_last_two(names: list[str]) that: Checks that the list includes two or more elements. If not it should return None . Returns both as a tuple. Define another function named main() that: Creates a list of names. Calls get_last_two() and if the returned value is not None it prints both returned values, one per line; otherwise, print a message indicating that no values were found. At the end of your file, include a call to main Run the program and confirm that the program displays the correct results. Test your program with varying lengths of lists including an empty list and a list with only one element. If something doesn’t look right, review your code and fix any issues before moving on.

110	2686290	Lab: Problem Solve 19	ITSC 1212 Problem Solve 19 Overview and Instructions Overview In this lab, you’ll explore how Python represents and manipulates sequences - ordered collections of data such as strings, lists. You’ll practice using indexing to access specific elements, applying sequence methods like .split() and .count() , and writing functions that combine these tools to process and display information. As you move through the activities, you’ll start with basic indexing across multiple lists, then work with string splitting, substring counting, and whole-word counting. The exercises are intended to help you understand not just how to work with individual elements, but how to analyze and transform sequences of data efficiently and clearly in Python. Happy coding and learning! Tasks Instructions: 🐥 (pet me!)

Task 1 Create a new Python file and name it car_info.py Your task is to write a program that defines and calls a function named get_car_info(makes, years, prices, choice) to display information about a collection of cars using functions and indexing.  There are three lists that describe cars: one list for car makes, one list for their year, and one for their price. Each car’s information is stored at the same index across both lists. Define get_car_info(makes, years, prices, choice) (with type annotations) that: Takes three lists (makes, years, and prices) and the user’s numeric choice. Uses indexing to access the correct car data. Returns a formatted string describing the car. Define a main() function that: Declares the three lists (makes, years, and prices). # cars details makes = [ 'Maserati' , 'Honda' , 'Subaru' , 'Fiat' , 'Ford' , 'Porsche' , 'Mazda' , 'Lotus' ] years = [2004, 1989, 2002, 2016, 2008, 1989, 2023, 2011] prices = [18000, 2499, 6000, 8495, 15499, 33250, 34999, 63915] Prompts the user for a number between 1 and 8 (assuming the lists include 8 elements) Your program should validate the user’s input. If the user enters a number that is not between 1 and the length of the lists, keep prompting until they enter a valid number. Use a while loop to repeat the prompt until a valid input is received. Calls get_car_info() and prints the returned string. At the bottom of your program, call main() . Run the program and confirm that the program displays the correct results. If something doesn’t look right, review your code and fix any issues before moving on. Example run: Enter a number between 1 and 8: 1\n$18000: A Maserati made in 2004. Enter a number between 1 and 8: 9\nTry again. Please enter a valid number between 1 and 8 Enter a number between 1 and 8: 4\n$8495: A Fiat made in 2016. Task 2 Create a new Python file and name it word_info.py Your task is to write a program that defines and calls a function named get_position(sentence, position) that splits a sentence and returns information about one of its words. Define a function named get_position(sentence, position) (with type annotations) that: Takes a string ( sentence ) and an integer ( position ) as parameters. Splits the sentence into a list of words using the split() method. You can assume the words are separated by a space character and the sentence does not include any punctuation. Uses indexing to access the word at the given position. Returns a formatted string such as: "Word 3 is 'morning' and it has 7 letters." Define a main() function that: Prompts the user to enter a sentence. Prompts the user to enter a word position (as a number). You can assume the user will enter a valid position within the range of words in the sentence. Calls get_position() and prints the returned message. At the bottom of your program, call main() Run the program and confirm that the program displays the correct results. If something doesn’t look right, review your code and fix any issues before moving on. Example run: Enter a sentence: good morning sunshine\nEnter a word position: 2\nWord 2 is 'morning' and it has 7 letters Enter a sentence: Python makes coding fun Enter a word position: 4 Word 4 is 'fun' and it has 3 letters Task 3 Continue in the same Python file, word_info.py Your task is to add a function that extends analyzing text by counting how many times a particular term or letter appears in a sentence. You’ll write a function that takes a sentence and a search term, and returns a message describing how many times it appears. Define count_term_occurrences(sentence, term) (with type annotations) that: Takes a string sentence and a string term as parameters. Uses the string method .count() to count how many times term appears in sentence . Returns a formatted string describing the result. Update the main() function so that: Prompts the user to enter a term or letter to search for. Calls count_term_occurrences() and prints the returned message. Run the program and confirm that the program displays the correct results. If something doesn’t look right, review your code and fix any issues before moving on. Example run: Enter a sentence: Anaya is bringing banana bread and bananas Enter a word or letter to search for: ana The term 'ana' appears 2 times in your sentence. Explore Python’s string method documentation (e.g., .lower() , .upper() , .find() , .replace() , .startswith() , etc.). Using these methods, modify your function so that the search is case-insensitive, meaning it works correctly regardless of whether the letters in the sentence or search term are uppercase or lowercase. Example run: Enter a sentence: Anaya is bringing banana bread and bananas Enter a word or letter to search for: ana The term 'ana' appears 3 times in your sentence. Possible Extension Challenge Add a function count_word_occurrences(sentence, word) that counts how many times the given word appears in the sentence. Update your program so that it presents the user with a menu of analysis options after entering a sentence. This will help organize your program and give the user more control over what kind of analysis they want to perform. You can also add additional options. Be creative! ☺️ Choose an option:\n1 - Find the position of a word in the sentence 2 - Count how many times a term or letter appears\n3 - Show total number of words in the sentence 4 - Show the last two words in the sentence 5 - Quit Post-Task This task is a warm-up for the next problem-solving activity. Try it on your own before the next lab session, and come ready to review, improve, and extend your solution. Write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers in a list using a while loop. This exercise will help you practice using loops to access list elements by index, accumulate results, and control repetition. Define a function named sum_list(numbers: list[float) that: Takes a list of numbers as a parameter. Uses a while loop to iterate through the list. Computes the total sum and returns it. Define a main() function that: Contains a list of numbers (you can hardcode it. Later we will learn how to gradually build a list which we can use to prompt the user to enter them). Calls sum_list() and displays the total sum. At the bottom of your file, include a call to main() . Run the program and confirm that the program displays the correct results. If something doesn’t look right, review your code and fix any issues before moving on. Examples: Total sum: 24.7  # [3, 5, 7.7, 9] \nTotal sum: 12    # [10, -4, 6] Deliverables Credit for this assignment is earned by completing, submitting your completed tasks and by reviewing your work with a member of the instructional team.

Test functions systematically using sample inputs and expected outputs to verify correctness. Document your code effectively using docstrings that connect the IPO structure to the function’s purpose and behavior.	\N	f	f	\N	252047	202580-Fall 2025-ITSC-1212_Combined
112	2686294	Lab: Problem Solve 22	ITSC 1212 Problem Solve 22 Overview and Instructions Overview Welcome to our final lab of the course! In this capstone practice, you’ll pull together core skills: working with sequences (lists), writing and calling functions, formatting output, and handling user input and validation using a Top 100 songs dataset. You’ll start by generating a formatted Top 10, then build a targeted lookup that classifies a song’s rank (Top 10, Top 50, Top 100).  You also have an opportunity to explore simple analytics (e.g., counting songs by artist) and a fun random recommendation through the optional extensions. What you’ll practice Designing clear function interfaces with type annotations. Accessing and aligning data across parallel lists. Validating user input and displaying helpful error messages. Producing readable, formatted output for end users. (Optional) Extending functionality with small, purposeful helper functions. Tasks Instructions: 🐥 (pet me!) You’ve made it to the final lab... congratulations ! 🎉 This last exercise ties together the core programming ideas you’ve practiced all term: using functions to organize logic, working with lists to store and retrieve data, and thinking carefully about how programs interact with users. Remember, every skill you’ve built here: breaking problems into smaller parts, testing and refining your code, and approaching challenges step by step will serve you well beyond this course. Keep experimenting, keep asking why , and keep coding with curiosity. You’ve come a long way...be proud of your progress and how much more you now understand about how computers “think.” 🌟 Make sure to use the suggested filenames. Include a docstring for each function that clearl y states the Input-Process-Output (IPO). Use type annotations for all function parameters and return values to make your code clearer. Example: def add_tax(price: float, tax_rate: float) -> float: After you finish writing your programs, take time to test them in different ways, not just with the example inputs, but also with your own variations. Run your program multiple times, try unexpected or edge cases, and verify that the outputs match what you expect to happen. Task 1 Create a new file named word_guess.py Your task is to write a program that define and calls a function named generate_hint that takes a word and a guess as input and returns a hint string. The function simulates a guessing game in which a player tries to guess a hidden word. The hidden word consists only of uppercase letters (A-Z), and its length is provided to the player. Each guess made by the player will also consist of uppercase letters and must match the length of the hidden word. After each guess, the function should return a hint string based on a comparison between the hidden word and the guess, following these rules: If a letter in the guess matches exactly (i.e., same letter in the same position) with the hidden word, the hint at that position should contain that letter. If a letter in the guess is present in the hidden word but in a different position, the hint should contain a + symbol at that position. If a letter in the guess is not present in the hidden word at all, the hint should contain a * symbol at that position The function should take two parameters: hidden_word : a string representing the word the player is trying to guess. guess : a string representing the player’s guessed word. The function should return a string that represents the hint, generated by comparing the hidden_word and guess according to the specified rules. For example if the following function calls were executed the corresponding hints would be returned: generate_hint("APPLE", "PLANT) returns +++** The first letter "P", the second letter "L" and the third letter "A" are in the word but in the wrong positions, so they get a + . The letters "N", and "T" are not in the word at all, so they get * . generate_hint("APPLE", "SLATE") returns *++*E The fifth letter "E" is in the correct position. The third letter "A" is in the hidden word but in a different position, so it gets + . The letters "S", "L", and "T" are not in the word, so they get * . generate_hint("APPLE", "AMPLE") returns A*PLE The first letter "A", the third letter "P", the fourth letter "L" and the fifth letter "E" are in the correct positions. The second letter "M" is  not in the word, so it gets * . generate_hint("APPLE", "APPLE") returns APPLE All the letters are in the correct positions. Task 2 Create a new file named song_info.py Your task is to write a program that defines and calls a function named top_10 that displays information about a song’s position in the Top 100 chart. Define a function named top_10(song_titles:list, artists:list) -> list that: Takes two lists (song_titles, artists). Uses the first 10 elements of each list to represent the top 10 songs. Builds and returns a list of formatted strings, where each string includes the song’s rank, title, and artist. and returns the top 10 song’s rank, title, and artist in a formatted lines in a list like: #1: "Good Life" by Billie Eilish #2: "I Want You To Know" by Joel Corry ... Define main() that: Declares two lists: song_name = ['Good Life', 'I Want You To Know', 'Lose You To Love Me', 'Love Runs Out', 'Alright', 'WAP', 'Ceiling Games', 'Moana', 'Hanuman Chalisa', 'Sleepover', 'Take Me To Church', 'You Are The Reason', 'Playing Townes', 'Sick Boy', 'Everybody Dies In Their Nightmares', 'Lonely Together', 'Girls Like You', 'Want It Kept', 'Bleeding Love', 'Jolene!', 'Titans', 'Apricots', 'Heat Waves', 'i hate u i love u', 'Photograph', 'Shayad', 'Memories', 'Moon Rider', 'Overdrive', 'The Way You Felt', 'Dandelions', 'Send Me An Angel', 'Love Yourself', 'Not Afraid', 'Alive', 'Closer', 'Party Girl', 'Hold It Against Me', 'Surrender', 'All Time Low', 'All Night', 'Soldier', 'Tere Sang Yaara', 'LET IT GO', 'Tory lanez freestyle', 'Boyfriend', 'I Get You', 'No Promises', 'Selfish Love', 'The Imitation Game', 'Rare', 'telepatía', 'I Need Some Sleep', 'I Want It That Way', 'Speechless', 'You & I', 'Talk', 'When We Were Young', 'She', 'Returning To Methuen', 'Glad You Came', 'Believe What I Say', 'Summer Thing', 'Cloudy Day', 'Rescue Me', 'All I Want', 'Phantoms and Friends', 'Try', 'SugarCrash!', 'Daddy Issues', 'Break My Heart Myself', 'Baila Conmigo', 'Mine', 'No Lie', 'Ophelia', 'Switch It Up', 'I Would Like', 'SOS', 'Woman Like Me', 'Just the Way You Are', 'u love u', 'I Won', 'ME!', 'Anxiety', 'Disrespectful', 'Bright Eyes', 'The One I Love', 'Solar Power', 'Jealous', 'Reasons', 'Unconditionally', 'Overwhelmed', 'Let You Down', 'You And Me', 'Legends', 'Malang', 'Sweet but Psycho', 'Rumors', 'Someone To Stay', 'Brush Fire'] artist_name = ['Billie Eilish', 'Joel Corry', 'Gryffin', 'Carlos Rafael Rivera', 'Ariana Grande', 'Ludovico Einaudi', 'Alan Walker', 'Jonas Blue', 'Ed Sheeran', 'Imagine Dragons', 'The Chainsmokers', 'Jax Jones', 'Ellie Goulding', 'Olivia Rodrigo', 'Conan Gray', 'Stateless', 'Amy Winehouse', 'Taylor Swift', 'Empire of the Sun', 'Big Sean', 'Pop Smoke', 'Christina Perri', 'Juice WRLD', 'Maroon 5', 'The Local Train', 'William Black', 'Ryan Mack', 'Calvin Harris', 'Romy', 'Armaan Malik', 'blackbear', 'Klaas', 'Selena Gomez', 'Macklemore & Ryan Lewis', 'The Cranberries', 'Joshua Burnside', 'Charlie Puth', 'WILDES', 'Ali Gatie', '42 Dugg', 'Sam Feldt', 'glaive', 'Kanye West', 'Lee DeWyze', 'Zodiac Wave', 'Nelly Furtado', 'Marshmello', 'Roy Jones Jr.', 'Eminem', 'One Direction', 'Jaden Thompson', 'Dua Lipa', 'Zedd', 'Kelly Clarkson', 'Ankur Tewari', 'Pitbull', 'joan', 'Trevor Daniel', 'Sleepy Hallow', 'Prateek Kuhad', 'SLANDER', 'Picture This', 'Enrique Iglesias', 'jxdn', 'KC Lights', 'Logic', 'Clinton Kane', 'vaultboy', 'Tyga', 'Tom Odell', 'Martin Jensen', 'ZAYN', 'MAX', 'Kina', 'Fall Out Boy', 'Camila Cabello', 'Lewis Capaldi', 'LOLO', 'FLETCHER', 'Kevin Gates', 'Ava Max', 'Young Money', 'Art Garfunkel', 'JD McPherson', 'Duncan Laurence', 'Secondcity', 'Yellow Claw', 'Yves V', 'Louis The Child', 'Tones And I', 'Trippie Redd', 'Sia', 'Internet Money', 'Kelli-Leigh', 'Jay Gwuapo', 'Bebe Rexha', '44phantom', 'Yann Tiersen', 'Rihanna', 'The Vamps'] Calls top_10() and stores the returned list. Prints each formatted line from the returned list. At the bottom of the file, call main() . Task 3 In your song_info.py add a function named display_song_info that displays information about a song’s position in the Top 100 chart. Make sure you add this file before the main function. Define a function named display_song_info(position:int, song_titles:list, artists:list) -> None that: Takes an integer position and two lists (song_titles, artists). Checks whether the position is valid (between 1 and 100). If not valid, display: Invalid position! Please enter a number between 1 and 100. If valid, display the song’s rank, title, and artist in a formatted line like: #3: "Lose You To Love Me" by Gryffin Then, display one of the following messages based on the song’s position: "This song is in the Top 10." if the position is between 1 and 10 "This song is in the Top 50." if the position is between 11 and 50 "This song is in the Top 100." if the position is between 51 and 100 Update main() so that: Prompts the user to enter a number representing a song’s position in the chart. Calls the display_song_info() function with the user’s input and both lists. Test your program Possible Extensions Add a function named count_songs_by_artist(artist_name, artists) that counts how many times that artist appears in the list and displays a message like: Taylor Swift has 6 songs in the Top 100 Add a function named find_artist_by_song(song_title, song_titles, artists ) that takes a song title and returns the matching artist’s name. If the song isn’t found, display Song not found in the Top 100 Add a function that uses the random module to pick a random song from the Top 100 and display it in the same formatted way: Random recommendation: #27 "Watermelon Sugar" by Harry Styles Deliverables Credit for this assignment is earned by completing, submitting your completed tasks and by reviewing your work with a member of the instructional team. Before your review practice showing that your code works and be ready to explain what each line does. During the review you are expected to: Use correct terminology (input, process, output, decision, etc.). Describe the steps you took and the choices you made while solving each problem. Demonstrate reflective thinking about your design and problem-solving approach. Reminder: The goal of the review is not just to show your answers, but to demonstrate your understanding of how and why your code solve the problems. How to Submit Upload your Python file for each task to Gradescope. word_guess.py song_info.py Knowledge Check In this lab you practiced how to: Define and call functions with parameters and return values to organize code into reusable, logical components. Work with parallel lists to align and retrieve related data (e.g., song titles and artists) using matching indexes. Use type annotations to clarify expected input and output types, improving code readability and reliability. Apply index-based data access to display ranked information in a structured, formatted way (e.g., #1: "Song" by Artist). Implement input validation and conditional logic to handle out-of-range values gracefully. Use conditional classification to categorize songs (Top 10, Top 50, Top 100) based on rank. Extend functionality through additional helper functions, such as counting songs by artist or selecting a random recommendation. Practice testing and debugging by verifying your program’s behavior with different inputs and edge cases.	\N	f	f	\N	252047	202580-Fall 2025-ITSC-1212_Combined

There’s no code before the loop to change it, so the first printed value is 1 , not 2 1 2 3 Correct: The loop runs while count < 4 . When count becomes 4 , the condition is False, so the loop stops. The loop body executes for count = 1 , 2 , and 3 , so those values will be displayed Nothing, because the loop never runs The loop does run because the initial condition 1 < 4 is True. It would only skip if the condition were False at the start (for example, if count = 5 ).	\N	f	f	\N	252047	202580-Fall 2025-ITSC-1212_Combined

6	2652799	Mini-Assignment 2	For this assignment, please write an outline of the textbook chapter for the week ( https://www.americanyawp.com/text/05-the-american-revolution/ ). Please write your outline of Chapter 5 on paper, and then submit a picture or scanned PDF of it to the Canvas assignment portal. I still want to hold you accountable for completing the process by hand (which is what we would have done as an in-class mini assignment). I also recognize that many of you will actually want to keep these notes. Submitting a photo/scan allows both things to happen simultaneously. You may use bullet points, or letters/numbers, but I must be able to clearly see the levels of information We discussed and practiced some strategies for outlining in class on Friday (08/29), so review your notes if you're not sure what to do. Remember: it doesn't have to be perfect, or even identical to what I would do. It just has to represent the basic information in the chapter. I am not overly concerned with your handwriting (historians read bad handwriting for a living), but please do your best to make it legible for me. This assignment will be (mostly) graded on completion.	2025-09-02 15:49:59	f	f	\N	244951	202580-Fall 2025-HIST-1575-008-American Democracy

237	2645321	HW #2: Searching & Evaluating Secondary Sources	Overview The purposes of this studio are to introduce you to the following three foundational research concepts and to give you low-stakes practice with each: Developing research questions Preliminary searching Lateral reading Your final task is to post a short response in the Discussion board reflecting on what you did and what you learned. Developing research questions You recently started to (or are about to start to) develop some inquiry questions for your upcoming Inquiry Project (IP). Generally, academics (people in academia) start research projects with questions. They are curious about something in their field, and they want to find answers. Developing curiosity and learning how to ask questions are skills you'll acquire throughout college. Research begins with curiosity. Academics often start not with a claim, but with a question. Your goal is to develop 2–3 possible inquiry questions related to a topic you’re interested in exploring this semester. 💡 Examples of student questions: Food: Is lab-grown meat the future of sustainable eating? College life: Do university meal plans meet the nutritional needs of student athletes? Sports: Why has baseball declined in popularity among Gen Z? More examples: Below is a list of past student projects (you may have seen this before in class) so you can get a feel for how researchers develop projects from their own interests: Broad interest: Food Possible Questions: Why has the “foodie culture” become so prominent in the past few years? OR, Is "clean meat" (lab-grown) the meat of the future? Broad interest: College life Possible Questions: How can students stay healthy at college when they live on campus? OR, Do university meal plans offer college athletes enough nutrition? Broad interest: Weight Lifting Possible Questions: Why is weight lifting healthy for college students? OR, Why should females lift weights instead of focusing exclusively on cardio? Broad interest: Becoming a pediatrician or a physical therapist Possible Questions: What does it take to become a pediatrician? OR, How will the ever-changing Affordable Care Act impact how a young pediatrician (or physical therapist) builds his/her career? Broad interest: The Outdoors Possible Questions: Are people who live in cities as healthy as those who live in more rural areas? Or, Does trail running offer more benefits than running on the street or on a treadmill? Broad interests: Sports Possible Questions: How can the MLB help baseball become America's favorite pastime again? Or, Does Roger Goodell manage the NFL effectively? 🌞 Instructions : Take 5–10 minutes to reflect and brainstorm in a separate doc or notebook. Then select 2–3 inquiry questions to include in your post. Keep in mind that we're working in a short timeframe. You'll need some questions that are narrow enough to explore fully in a condensed semester. 2. Preliminary searching Sometimes this is the most time-consuming part of research!  I used a "conversation" metaphor to describe research. It was created by philosopher Kenneth Burke to describe the social aspects of research. He wrote about research as a "parlor," a party with many little conversations happening among its guests, and how it's difficult as an outsider to join those conversations. As you begin preliminary searching, you'll be reminded that--more than likely--a "conversation" is already happening out there about whatever it is you're interested in researching. 🌞Instructions: Practice some preliminary searching in Google, Google Scholar, and Wikipedia using the 2-3 possible topics/inquiry questions you developed earlier in this Studio. Get a feel for the conversation around each broad topic/question, with the goal of eventually narrowing your focus to one specific research question to pursue. As you look, see what you can see about... Using Google, Wikipedia, or Google Scholar, spend 10–15 minutes exploring your topic. Try to get a feel for: Who is part of this conversation? (experts, journalists, educators?) What kinds of perspectives are out there? What terms, issues, or angles come up frequently? The history of the conversation. Pay attention to dates. Often we want current sources from the past few years, but historical sources can be very helpful. This doesn't have to be comprehensive—just take a quick scan of what's already out there. For a long time, we told students that Wikipedia wasn't a reliable source, but it has built a reputation for being well-monitored and for having excellent references at the ends of articles. You can get great sources from the references listed at the bottom of a Wikipedia entry. (Check out the chapter in our textbook about Wikipedia, too!) Lateral reading Watch this video about lateral reading-   (Plan ahead: This is a 14-minute video.) https://youtu.be/GoQG6Tin-1E 🌞 Instructions : You will practice lateral reading and keep notes. You'll include these notes in your Discussion post. Next, pick one of the following options: A. Research The Humane League (THL) using lateral reading strategies. What do others say about this organization? What’s their credibility? B. Choose a source, author, or idea that came up during your searching and do a quick lateral read—what did you learn about their reputation or background? Keep track of what you learn, and where you learn it (websites). Keep track of what you type into search bars, too. Use what you learned in the video--go lateral! After you spend some time (10-15 min) lateral reading, answer these questions: In what kinds of research projects could you use The Humane League [or another one you focused on] as a source? How would you use them as a source? In what ways would you introduce them as a source? Again, record your findings: you'll need them later. *Note: Do not merely do your research for this step. This question is asking you to lateral read in order to learn about an idea, a source, or an author you came across in your preliminary searching. 🌞 Instructions : In your Discussion post (hit "Reply" below), please include the following: Your post does not need to be long—aim for 200–300 words total. Include: A.) 2–3 potential inquiry questions B.) A short paragraph about your preliminary searching—what stood out to you? C.) A summary of your lateral reading practice—what did you learn and how did it change your view? D.) One reflection: What was the most useful or surprising thing you noticed during this activity? ✅ You do not need to reply to classmates (though you’re welcome to!).	2025-09-17 22:45:05	f	f	\N	241043	202580-Fall 2025-WRDS-1103-048-Wrtng & Inqry Acdmc Ctx I & II
238	2645325	Midterm	The purpose of this midterm assignment is to help you practice critical reflection in preparation for your final Portfolio and to help your instructor assess your learning and progress so far. You will reflect on your engagement with major course concepts, your own writing and thinking, and your goals for the second half of the semester. This essay also gives you the opportunity to practice digital design techniques and engage with the genre of the digital reflective essay. Pre-Writing Activities Before you begin writing, please: Re-read your earlier journal entries and writing assignments , especially your Rhetorical Concepts response and any drafts or letters. Re-watch this 3-minute video from Purdue OWL: Introduction to Rhetoric Review the WRDS 1103 Essential Vocabulary document. Which terms have you started to understand or use? Which ones are still unfamiliar or unclear? Skim through the sample Portfolios (Canvas > Modules > Course Essentials). Notice how students reflect on their own work, use examples from assignments, and organize their digital writing. Review the digital design slideshow by Dr. Cat Mahaffey (linked here in Canvas). Ok? Start with the detailed instructions here: Re-watch this3-minutee video about rhetoric. Purdue Owl: Introduction to Rhetoric https://youtu.be/mIESu4yXco4 Revisit Essential Vocabulary for WRDS 1103 and 1104 . Which terms are you more familiar with than the last time you looked through this document? There might be some you've been using in class, even if we haven't explicitly acknowledged them. Which terms may be useful in your Midterm to help you explain what you've been learning thus far? Next, please look through the sample Portfolios listed in Modules-->Course Essentials. I don't think you have to read them word-for-word at this point, but read enough to get a feel for the assignment. Be sure to click on some of the links so that you can see the "artifacts" those students chose to include. What you'll notice about the Sample Portfolios: These Portfolios are REFLECTIVE . These students looked back through their experience and work in WRDS to explain what they learned and to come to some conclusions. Analyzing your own writing/thinking/work is what we call critical reflection. You might remember the term "critical reflection" from earlier in the semester (Studio 1 and maybe other places as well). Note: You've been practicing general reflection all semester in your Journal. You've been practicing c ritical reflection as well, particularly in peer review and when you write Dear Reader letters. These essays are LONG . As a college student, you will probably be asked to write longer and longer pieces. Note: If you're unfamiliar with writing essays that are longer than 4-5 pages, most students find reflective writing a comfortable place to start. The Portfolio will be good practice for later. These essays are DIGITAL . You will probably also be asked to write more and more digital texts: i.,e. texts that are meant to be read on the screen, like your Portfolio, never intended to be printed on paper. Writing digitally takes some practice, especially if what you're writing is relatively long. Creating a text that is easy for a reader to navigate and understand on the screen is a little different than creating a traditional, printed essay. To begin to think about digital design, please read the following slideshow put together by my colleague, Dr. Cat Mahaffey. As always, I suggest keeping your Journal open and writing any questions that you have about the reading. There will be a place to include your questions at the end of your Midterm. Some of the concepts in this slideshow may be new to you, and we will be returning to them in the second half of this course, but your questions will help me plan. Click the above image to accessthe  slideshow. In short, a digital essay like your Portfolio is multi-modal. It will communicate in multiple ways: you will arrange words and images in ways that will best communicate your ideas to your reader. It may be helpful now to consider this Canvas page and some of the digital documents I've shared with you this semester: The page uses images , bolded font , colored font , a bulleted list and a numbered list , and hyperlinks to make it easier to navigate and read. The syllabus uses tables , a color scheme , headings , an outline , and hyperlinks to make it easier to navigate. These Peer Review Instructions use a table with colored backgrounds for easier reading. If I hadn't thought about my readers, I would have used black text on the white screen. I would've organized my text in paragraphs, but I may not have done much else to help my readers through the dense content. But, as a writer, my job is to consider my readers and figure out how to get my point across efficiently and effectively. The digital design concepts introduced in the slideshow can help you do just that. So, let's practice in your Midterm... Since your Midterm will be a reflective essay (like your Portfolio), you'll want to take some time to reflect before you start writing. Take this opportunity to look back through all the work you've done in this course. Most of it will be in your Journal. You'll want to look at your drafts and peer review materials as well, including feedback your peers and I have left for you. It may be helpful to look through Canvas, too. If you're fuzzy on any of the assignment directions, take a few minutes to read over the assignment sheets, textbook chapter,  or perhaps look through our Discussions. Read back through the "Course Objectives" portion of the syllabus (SLO's and Key Concepts). 3. Writing Task: ( approx. 750–1,000 words) that includes: 1. What You’ve Learned So Far Choose 2–3 SLOs or Key Concepts that you feel you’re engaging with deeply. Explain what each concept means in your own words. Quote from your own work (Journal, assignment, or peer review) at least once for each concept to show how you’re practicing it. 2. What You’re Still Working On Identify 1–2 SLOs or Key Concepts that still feel challenging or "muddy." Be specific: What confuses you? What hasn’t clicked yet? Brainstorm how you might work on these in the second half of the course. Refer to at least 3 course resources (Canvas pages, readings, supplemental information sheets, or videos). Quote from at least one of them. 3. Digital Design and Reflection Use headings and other digital design elements (hyperlinks, bullet points, font size, bold, color) to improve readability. Consider how you can guide your reader through your digital text effectively and clearly. How to Submit : Write your Midterm Essay in Google Docs . Title your document: LastName_Midterm_WRDS1103 Make sure your sharing settings are set to: "Anyone at UNCC with the link can edit" First, upload your file. Second, please make sure your settings are such that I can EDIT.** Paste the share link in the Canvas comment box for the Midterm assignment.

239	2645326	Quoting Source Material HW	Click the image for more info! This assignment will help you practice how and why to quote source material in academic writing. You’ll learn how to introduce quotes smoothly, cite them correctly in APA style, and reflect on your process. Note: This assignment is deceiving in that it might take you longer than it seems like it would. It requires some reading, so please set aside ~75–90 minutes to complete it. There are many reasons to quote source material in your writing, both in research-based writing and reflective writing . Step 1: Why Quote? In research-based writing , you quote from source material for reasons you’re probably familiar with. To establish your ethos as a well-informed, diligent researcher. To illustrate that you understand the larger "conversation" you're entering. E.g., from Suzanne Halaburda in our dept. journal: Writing scholar and professor Alice Horning is known for her work on critical reading. In her faculty biography at Oakland University she says that “every course is a reading course and a writing course.” In an article about critical reading (2007), she makes the case that students will benefit from more “direct instruction in the use of personal and rhetorical reading strategies,” and she points to a previous study’s findings that students have a much easier time learning critical reading strategies when they are asked to read accessible texts about familiar topics (p. 5). Peer review like the ones I described above achieve these goals: they guide us through readable texts, texts that are usually about topics we are familiar with and can relate to, by asking us to respond to them personally (as a reader and as a fellow student) and rhetorically. When Horning mentions “rhetorical reading strategies,” she is referring to strategies that help us see the text at hand as a series of decisions its author made (Bunn, 2011). To help you use the right vocabulary and to be precise. E.g. from a former student's (Mariah Olsen's) research project: It wasn’t until 2001 that Dr. Markus Raichle pointed out a network of areas in the brain that seemed to turn off whenever someone focused on a particular task and back on again when no task was at hand. His observation unleashed a plethora of research about the brain’s default, “task-negative,” network, and over the next ten years it became apparent that these areas of the brain are involved in very personal, identity-related thought processes (para. 12). To provide evidence for claims you're making. Most people don't know that egg farmers practice debeaking, or "beak trimming" as it is referred to in the United Egg Producers' 2017 "Guidelines for US Egg-Laying Flocks" (p. 9). . . . The United Egg Producers acknowledge this in their guidelines: "Under certain management systems (e.g., exposure to high intensity natural lighting) and with some genetic stocks, beak trimming/treatment may be required" (p. 9). When a source says something so well that you simply can't improve it by paraphrasing. E.g. As Lamott (1994) so honestly states, "Very few writers really know what they are doing until they've done it" (p. 301). Step 2: Read Before You Write For this assignment, please start by reading the above examples (all about quoting). Then--to distinguish between quoting, paraphrasing, and summarizing--please skim "Quoting, Paraphrasing, and Summarizing." Then read THIS chapter from They Say/I Say: The Moves That Matter in Academic Writing (pp. 43–44) . Focus on the templates for introducing quotes. (Tip: These templates will guide your practice.) Intro to Quoting Well Step 3: Practice with Quotes Open a Google Doc and complete the following: Part A. Introducing Quotes Choose two quotes from your Research Log sources and one quote from a course reading (or another from your log). Use a They Say/I Say template to introduce each quote. Add 1–2 sentences explaining the quote in your own words. You can color code the templates like I did in the examples below. E.g. In his book Mercy for Animals , Runkle maintains that "[f]ish deserve to be more than food. They deserve our compassion." Runkle's point is that fish are smart, social, sentient beings who deserve to be treated as such. Part B. APA Citation Practice For each of your three quotes, add an APA in-text citation . Make sure you try both: Narrative citation (Author, year, p. # appears within your sentence). Parenthetical citation (everything in parentheses at the end). E.g. In his book Mercy for Animals , Runkle (2017) maintains that "[f]ish deserve to be more than food. They deserve our compassion" (p. 73). Runkle's point is that fish are smart, social, sentient beings who deserve to be treated as such. You'll notice that in APA, it is typical to introduce the author and to cite the year early in the sentence, and then you only have to cite the p. or para. number at the end of the sentence. It is possible to save the author's last name for the end, in which case your citation would look like this: In the book Mercy for Animals , the author maintains that "[f]ish deserve to be more than food. They deserve our compassion" (Runkle, 2017, p. 73). Runkle's point is that fish are smart, social, sentient beings who deserve to be treated as such. However, I'd like you to get into the habit of introducing your sources BEFORE you quote from them because that is conventional in academic writing and is expected by your readers. Basically, your readers expect to know whose words they're reading before they're reading them. They don't want to be wondering whose words they're reading, and they don't want to be surprised by a citation at the end of a sentence. Be clear about who and what you're quoting, right off the bat. Part C. Reflection At the end of your Doc, write a short response (4–5 sentences): Which template felt most natural to you? Which was hardest to use, and why? What questions do you still have about quoting or APA?

160	2594899	📝 Engagement Across Perspectives	Engagement Across Perspectives Due: Friday, September 12th at 11:59pm (assignment will remain open until Sunday, September 14) What is the “Engagement Across Perspectives” assignment? In this course, you’ve started developing your identity as a computer science student. Understanding your learning preferences, work habits, and personal background can help you become more effective in collaborative environments, group projects, ethical decision making, and technical problem-solving. This assignment gives you an opportunity to reflect on how these factors shape your experiences in computer science. What needs to be completed for this assignment? Write a short reflection paper (2–3 pages) that answers all of the following prompts. Focus on connecting your responses to your experience as a learner, problem solver, and collaborator in computer science. Paper prompts: Describe yourself using at least two aspects of your background, experience, or identity that influence how you learn and work. (e.g., interests, cultural or social background, academic experience, family, career goals) Reflect on how your approach to communication, problem-solving, or collaboration might differ from or align with others'. (Consider behaviors, communication styles, or perspectives you've encountered in teams or classrooms.) Describe a moment when you realized that someone else's perspective or behavior in a team or class setting differed from your own. (What did you learn from the experience? How did it shape how you interpreted the situation?) In your own words, what does it mean to make assumptions in a team setting, and how might those assumptions affect collaboration in a computer science context (e.g., during projects, code review, or problem-solving)? Describe a time when assumptions, yours or someone else’s, affected how a group worked together on an academic task. How can becoming more aware of your working style and perspective help you become a better teammate in computer science?

Learning how to balance classes, studying, jobs, and personal life is key to your success and well-being. For this discussion, reflect on your current approach to managing time and how you plan to stay on track this semester. In your initial post, respond to the following questions: How do you currently plan or track your weekly tasks and deadlines (e.g., planner, calendar app, mental checklist)? What time management challenges have you faced in the past, and how did you try to overcome them? What strategies or habits are you hoping to develop this semester to stay organized and reduce stress? Is there a specific time of day or environment where you do your best thinking or coding? After you post, read through your groupmates’ responses. Reply to at least two classmates with a thoughtful comment (minimum two full sentences per reply). You might: Share a tip or tool that’s worked well for you Relate to a challenge they’ve mentioned Ask a follow-up question or suggest a strategy Offer support or encouragement Please note: It is suggested to complete your initial post by Wednesday, and then do your response posts by the Friday due date.

247	2645339	Rhetorical Concepts Shape Our World // Threshold Concepts	The purpose of this assignment is to introduce you threshold concepts as well as a main threshold concept of Writing Studies/this course: rhetoric. PART 1: Understanding Rhetoric (15–20 minutes) Rhetoric is at the heart of this class. After all, this is an intro to Writing Studies class in the Writing, Rhetoric , and Digital Studies department. As we inquire into the topic of writing this semester, we will also be studying rhetoric . We'll be building our understanding of what rhetoric is, why it's important, how others use it, and how we use it as well. You can't really study writing without studying rhetoric. It's also difficult to study writing and rhetoric in the 21st century without also considering digital studies . How do writers communicate in digital spaces, and why is it important? We will get to digital writing later this semester. For now, let's focus on setting a foundation for studying rhetoric. Purpose: To introduce you to rhetoric—a threshold concept in Writing Studies—and get you thinking about how rhetorical awareness can impact the way you read, write, and think. This studio will also help you understand what a threshold concept is and how it changes your thinking in any discipline. ✅ Step 1: Watch this 3-minute overview. Purdue OWL: Introduction to Rhetoric Key Terms from video : rhetoric : using the available means of persuasion to make an argument (Sometimes I find it helpful to simplify this definition even further to "purposeful language use." That helps us see how we can study almost anything rhetorically.) rhetorical awareness : an awareness of the language choices writers/we make rhetorical tools/strategies : tools speakers/writers can use to make their language more effective, their argument more compelling (E.g. humor, simile, hyperbole, symbolism, ethos, pathos, logos, etc.) argument : persuasion (We use the word "argument" in academic writing more like the word "purpose." "What is your argument here?" means "What is your purpose for writing this?") rhetorical situation (not in video) : t he situation you find yourself in as a writer who has to produce a text or as a reader who has to consume a text The last term in the list above implies that studying rhetoric is helpful to us as writers and as readers. You can read and write with rhetorical awareness. I.e. an awareness of the choices the writer made while writing. Why did this writer use these words? Why did this writer open this essay with an anecdote? Why does this writer rely so heavily on hyperbole? What can I do to further my point in this essay? When studying rhetoric, the first step to analyzing your rhetorical situation (as a reader or a writer) is the rhetorical triangle. Note : You just learned that rhetoric has its roots in ancient Greece where they studied public speech. That's why you often see "speaker" and "audience" instead of "writer" and "readers," but these terms are interchangeable. Consider, for instance, how your writing changes based on your reader. You wouldn’t write an e-mail to me asking for a deadline extension using the same language you would use in a text to your best friend asking for a ride to campus. You will adapt your writing to fit your rhetorical situation, based on the parts of your triangle. ✅ Step 2: Brief Reflection In your Google folder, create a document titled "Threshold Concepts Reflection." Write 3–5 bullet points responding to these prompts: What does rhetoric mean, in your own words? What’s one example of how you change your language based on who you're talking to? Why might it be useful to think about writing and reading rhetorically? Threshold Concepts (15–20 minutes) All fields or disciplines of study, including Writing Studies, have what educators call threshold concepts . You just learned about one of Writing Studies' threshold concepts, rhetoric . Understanding a threshold concept is moving to a different lens or way of perceiving something. Consider when you learned new information that radically changed your way of thinking about the subject. E.g. Maybe you are an athlete or fitness enthusiast. You always put in 110% every day, with no breaks, but your performance does not improve. Then you learn that recovery is crucial to performance. You add periodic recovery days and ice baths, and you put a greater emphasis on your nutrition. Then you begin to see improvement! You crossed a threshold to a new way of thinking about and practicing your craft. Returning to rhetoric, for example: studying rhetoric--learning how to view reading and writing rhetorically by seeing the choices writers made/can make in their particular situation--will allow you to think about writing in a new way. In chapter 1 of Writing About Writing ( a popular First-Year Writing textbook), the authors explain this threshold concept this way: "'Rhetorical Choices Shape Our World [....] Every time we use language and other forms of communication (such as photos, drawings, charts, gestures, facial expressions), we are making choices. These acts of communication are rhetorical -- they involve adapting our language and meaning to account for the needs, values, and expectations of those with whom we're interacting. These rhetorical choices have real and sometimes very serious consequences" (p. 14). This will make more sense as we continue to develop our rhetorical awareness. ✅ Step 3: Watch  the video below about threshold concepts: Threshold Concepts ✅ Step 4: Skim Vocabulary Skim this handout: Essential Vocabulary for WRDS 1103 and WRDS 1104 . As you skim this document, look for words you're familiar with, and words you're interested in learning more about. You'll see "threshold concepts" on the list! ✅ Step 5: Short Writing In the same document, add a short paragraph (4–5 sentences) responding to these prompts: Describe a time (academic or personal) when you learned something that totally changed your thinking. Why do you think “rhetoric” is considered a threshold concept in writing studies? Pick one vocabulary term that interests you—what do you think it means? ✅ Final Step End your doc with 1–2 questions you still have about rhetoric or threshold concepts.	2025-09-08 11:21:21	f	f	\N	241043	202580-Fall 2025-WRDS-1103-048-Wrtng & Inqry Acdmc Ctx I & II

Include the link as a comment. Purpose This essay helps you identify multiple perspectives around your research question and deepen your inquiry. You’ll imagine a “round table” of people or groups who are part of the ongoing conversation about your topic. What to Do: Review the Checklist Inquiry Question: Begin your essay by restating your current research question. If it’s evolved, explain briefly how and why. Define Your Round Table: Identify at least three key groups (or individuals who represent groups) involved in your issue. Avoid simple “for/against” divisions—focus on background, discipline, or lived experience. Explain Each Viewpoint: Describe each group’s perspective and reasoning. Include at least one direct quote and at least one paraphrase from a source for each group Use proper APA in-text citations. Compare & Contrast: Discuss how these viewpoints align or conflict. Reflection: End with how these perspectives influence your own current thinking or answer to your question. References Page: Include all sources cited, formatted in APA. Academic Integrity Reminder Your Round Table essay must be 100% your own original writing. Use your sources ethically, and do not use AI tools to generate or rewrite your work. Submitting AI-generated text will result in a failing grade for the entire course.	2025-11-06 17:03:48	f	f	\N	241043	202580-Fall 2025-WRDS-1103-048-Wrtng & Inqry Acdmc Ctx I & II

251	2656789	HW #1: Introduction as a Writer and a Student	HW #1: Introduction as a Writer and a Student Hi class! Let's take some time to get to know one another. For our first homework assignment, you will write a letter introducing yourself to me and the class, outlining your goals for the class, and sharing your experiences with writing up to this point. One of the things that makes a college writing class complex is that all of the students in the course come with a wide variety of writing experiences, attitudes toward writing, preferences, and skill sets. You likely began learning to write around the age of 2 or 3, and now you are in a higher education context, continuing to learn about writing. Let's think about where we are at the start of the class, who we are bringing to this space, and get to know who all we will be working with this semester. Instructions 1. Write your own letter to me and the class introducing yourself, your goals for the class, and your experiences with writing up to this point. Let me know here if you have any questions about the Canvas site or syllabus. Aim for 250 words. Optional: Include a picture of yourself in your post. Take 10–15 minutes to reflect on your history as a writer. Think about school, personal writing, work-related writing, or any time you’ve had to use writing to express yourself, make something happen, or figure something out. Respond to any of the following questions (you don’t need to answer them all—choose what speaks to you): What kinds of writing have you done in the past? What felt easy? What felt hard? How have teachers, peers, or other readers responded to your writing? How did that affect you? When have you felt most confident (or most unsure) as a writer? What beliefs about “good writing” do you carry with you—and where do you think those came from? What do you hope to learn or unlearn about writing this semester? 2. Next, review your peers' posts and consider connections, questions, or shared experiences.

253	2681587	Inquiry Question Brainstorm Forum	This forum is your space to share 2–3 tentative inquiry questions you’re considering for your Extended Inquiry Project. These questions should reflect your genuine curiosity and connect to a topic you’d be interested in exploring over the next few weeks. Remember: Inquiry questions are not the same as thesis statements. Good questions are open-ended, researchable, and connected to a larger academic or social conversation. You're not expected to have all the answers yet—this is just a starting place for your project. What to Post In your reply to this thread, include: 2–3 possible inquiry questions you're considering 1–2 sentences explaining what interests you about each one A link to your Inquiry Project Brainstorm Google Doc (Optional) A note about which question you’re leaning toward and why What to Look for in a Strong Question Is it open-ended (not yes/no)? Is it focused enough to research in the time we have? Does it connect to a bigger conversation (social, cultural, academic)? Is it something you’re genuinely curious to explore? Optional Peer Response After posting, you’re welcome to read through your peers’ questions. If you feel comfortable, reply to one or two classmates with encouraging feedback or a suggestion to make a question even stronger. Note You’ll continue refining your question in your Inquiry Google Doc, and we’ll return to these in the next class. This post helps you organize your thinking and gives me a sense of how to support your research direction. Let me know if you have questions—I’m excited to see what you’re curious about!	2025-09-16 16:04:30	f	f	\N	241043	202580-Fall 2025-WRDS-1103-048-Wrtng & Inqry Acdmc Ctx I & II

Use this discussion to reflect on your independent research progress and prepare for next week’s lesson on plagiarism, citation, and research ethics . Your post will count as attendance and participation for this class day. Prompt (Due by 11:59 PM Thursday, Oct. 16) In a single post ( 200–250 words ), respond thoughtfully to the questions below: Research Progress What is your current inquiry question or topic? How has it evolved since you first began researching? Source Reflection Briefly describe one source you’ve found recently that you might include or have included in your Research Log. Ensure you focus on a variety of perspectives. Where did you find it (library database, Google Scholar, website, etc.)? What makes it credible and useful? What new idea or perspective did it raise for you? Remember: You need to identify at least 3 distinct voices on your inquiry question. Looking Ahead What feels challenging or confusing about the research process right now (finding sources, evaluating credibility, using APA, etc.)? What’s one next step you’ll take before our next class on Tuesday to help round out your various perspectives? (Optional but encouraged: include an APA-style citation or link to your source.) Reminders for Tuesday, Oct. 21 (Class Day 17) Before next class, make sure to complete the following: Reading: Chapter 13, “ Doing Research is Fun; Citing Sources is Not: Understanding the Fuzzy Definition of Plagiarism .” ✍️ Take notes so you’re ready to discuss the reading in class.

262	2711105	Genre Project – Completion Checkpoint	Submission: Upload two separate documents or one Google Doc Reflection containing (1) your drafted Reflection and (2) your Genre Piece with working links. Total Points: Completion credit only — missing pieces = 0 Overview This assignment serves as a required completion checkpoint before your Final Portfolio. You are submitting: Your drafted Genre Reflection (2–3 pages, APA format) Your drafted Genre Piece (the multimodal artifact you created) Both components must be included together in this submission , with direct, working links to all external materials (Google Docs, Slides, images, videos, Canva pages, PDFs, etc.). If any links are missing, broken, or inaccessible, the assignment will receive a 0 until corrected. This checkpoint ensures I can verify that you have completed both parts before you polish them for the Final Portfolio. What You Must Submit 1. Drafted Genre Reflection (APA format, 2–3 pages) Your reflection must address the required questions outlined in the assignment sheet (“Genre Project” in Major Assignment Instructions), including: Your selected audience and why you chose them Your purpose/argument Your genre choice and where it would normally exist How you used rhetorical appeals and multiple modes How your Round Table research supported your choices (quote from at least 2 sources with APA in-text citations) The affordances and constraints of your chosen genre The kairos of your piece (why now?) Your assessment of the genre piece’s effectiveness This draft should be as complete as possible; it will form the basis of the version you revise and submit in your Final Portfolio. 2. Drafted Genre Piece (your multimodal creation) Upload or link to the full draft of your chosen genre piece. This can be linked within your Reflection Essay as a hyperlink. This can take many forms (see genre list in the assignment sheet), as long as it: Responds to your specific audience Conveys your purpose clearly Uses genre conventions appropriately Shows thoughtful rhetorical design choices and effort Is accessible via a direct link if digital If your genre piece lives online , you must include a direct, shareable link with “anyone with the link may view.” If it is physical or 3D, upload high-quality images or PDF scans. Submission Requirements To receive completion credit, your submission must include: Your Reflection draft Your Genre Piece draft Active, accessible links to all materials All files clearly labeled Sharing permissions set correctly If I cannot open your links → automatic 0 until fixed. If one of the two required components is missing → automatic 0 . Why This Checkpoint Matters The Genre Project is one of the major components of your Final Portfolio , and you cannot pass the course without completing all major assignments. This checkpoint verifies that: You have completed both parts You are on track for the final You are ready to revise, analyze, and integrate these materials into your Portfolio reflection Your work here does not need to be fully polished yet — but it must be complete, accessible, and authentic. I am looking for in-depth progress, not perfection.	\N	f	f	\N	241043	202580-Fall 2025-WRDS-1103-048-Wrtng & Inqry Acdmc Ctx I & II

1	244951	202580-Fall 2025-HIST-1575-008-American Democracy	HIST 1575: Foundations of American Democracy Fall 2025 Course: HIST 1575 Location and Time: MWF 9:05 -9:55 am; Denny 111 Instructor: Dr. Morgan Gray Office: Garinger 101 Office Hours : MWF 11:15 am – 12:15 pm or by appointment (in person); on Zoom by appointment Email: mgray60@charlotte.edu INTRODUCTION TO THE COURSE Welcome to Foundations of American Democracy! In this course, we’ll focus on the founding documents and use them as a basis for understanding movements for equality and civil rights throughout US history (but especially post-Civil War). Many of the basic themes may be familiar to you from your past education, but many of these narratives are much more complex than you may have seen before. In addition to continuing to develop your reading and writing skills, you will learn how to manage inaccessible language, a little bit about US law and social justice, and a LOT about the way that race, gender, class, and religion intersect. Regardless of your major, what you learn here will help you understand the world around you and participate in it more mindfully. COURSE DESCRIPTION When looked at through a justice-oriented lens, modern US history can be described as a process of working to apply equal rights to all. This course will examine this process, using the founding legal documents as an origin point, and considering the critical role of activists as well as evolving social dynamics and legal norms. In so doing, it will reveal both the real and imagined power of these documents and the importance (and challenges) of creating equality in the modern US context. THE CHARLOTTE CORE: THEME COURSES Being able to work and collaborate with diverse groups of people and to approach problems creatively are skills that employers want and that you need to succeed in college and your daily life. The Charlotte Core provides you with many opportunities to develop this engagement across perspectives competency in your Global and Local Theme courses, major, and co-curricular activities. This Local Theme course plays an important role in the Charlotte Core. It focuses on engaging students with the world in which they live as both individuals as well as members of society. You will learn the following engagement across perspectives skills while practicing critical thinking. Ask questions about familiar and unfamiliar communities and/or cultures Discuss cultural similarities and differences in perspectives, behaviors, expressions, and/or communication styles across space and/or time Interpret events, issues, problems, etc. from multiple perspectives Other Theme courses and courses in your major will build on the skills you develop in this class and provide you with even more opportunities to practice them. The Global Theme Courses (1501 and 1502) engage issues related to areas outside of the United States. The Local Theme Courses (1511 and 1512) engage issues related to areas within the United States. Assignments from this course may be used for general education continuous learning improvement regarding the competencies. All identifying information will be removed. Local Theme Local Themes Courses address the question: what does it mean to be a member of a local community, with a focus on: Appreciating what is different and understand what is similar in the experiences and expressions of different peoples, cultures, and communities in our city, our state, our region, and our nation Exploring how local structures (power dynamics, economic capacity, social capital) and cultural traditions (forms of expression, religious and ethnic identities, lines of thought) frame people’s experiences and the choices they make Identifying areas of commonality and contest that play out in the interactions between different groups in the town, city, state, region and country LEARNING OUTCOMES Our collective goals for the class are as follows: GUIDING QUESTIONS: What are the founding principles of American democracy? How have ideas of freedom, equality, and power changed since the founding of the country until the present? How has our understanding of democracy changed since the founding of the country? Is America exceptional? What does that mean? TECHNICAL SKILLS: Analytical writing Close reading Teamwork/collaboration Working to deadlines Written and oral communication LOCAL THEME OBJECTIVES: Ask questions about familiar and unfamiliar communities and/or cultures Discuss cultural similarities and differences in perspectives, behaviors, expressions, and/or communication styles across space and/or time Interpret events, issues, problems, etc. from multiple perspectives COMMUNICATING WITH ME The only way to successfully finish the semester together is to communicate, and communication is a two-way street. I will let you know about changes to the syllabus or to assignments (in addition to the classroom lessons themselves). In return, I would like you all to let me know if you have questions, or if problems arise that make it harder for you to participate in the class. Here are some great ways to get in touch with me: Canvas’s Message feature or via email : For all your standard communication needs. I will reply in 24-48 hours, depending on how many other emails I have. If you don’t hear from me in 48 hours, you’re welcome to send me a polite follow-up— it is entirely possible for emails to get lost in my inbox! Office hours: Office hours are my commitment to be in my office and available, so this is the best way to talk with me one-on-one. If you want me to look at a draft with you, to answer questions in a more detailed way, or just to chat about something, come on into my office. I’ll be there between 11:15 am and 12:15 pm on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday: no appointment necessary! If you can’t visit during those times, that’s okay. You can email me, and we can find a time that works for both of us. If you would prefer to meet via Zoom, I am happy to accommodate you. Just email me to set that up. Chatting after class: I always stick around after class while we pack up to leave, precisely so that you all can stop to ask questions or chat on the way out the door. It’s a great chance to ask for a quick clarification, to let me know of an impending absence, or just to say hi. RESPECT AND GROUP DISCUSSIONS While this course is technically a lecture course, you will find that we have a variety of opportunities to discuss and explore the themes of the course, both in small groups and as a class. These discussion formats are not designed to call anyone out or cause embarrassment, but rather to give you other ways to engage with the course concepts and to learn from one another. This may mean that you encounter ideas that generate some discomfort; that is often a normal part of intellectual growth! However, I will do my best to warn you of any potentially intense topics ahead of time, and you are always welcome to quietly excuse yourself if you need some breathing space. I would also encourage you to come and speak to me in office hours or to email me if you have any concerns. Respect is critical to these discussion-based interactions; comments should never be meant personally, so that your colleagues can learn not to take them personally. Feel free to disagree and debate appropriately with the class (even with me!), but freedom of speech does not grant you the privilege of being rude or making personal attacks. This holds doubly true for disrespect based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or any other identity. Diversity of experience and culture is essential to the field of history! COURSE MATERIALS For this class, you will need to purchase the following things: -       The 1575 Reader (published by the UNC Charlotte History Department) Access to Packback Both of these materials should be available to you with your Niner Course Pack and must be purchased through the campus bookstore , but if you are unable to access them for any reason, please talk with me ASAP! We will also use a free, online (open source) textbook occasionally; links to that will be available in Canvas as needed. Other materials include: Notetaking materials: This can be either a pen/pencil and paper, or a computer/tablet. Please use whichever format will allow you to learn and retain information. I will not allow you to use your phone or laptop to take notes in class (see below), so please make sure that you have an alternate strategy! Paper and something to write with : Even if you prefer to use a tablet for your notes, you will still need paper and a writing tool to complete in-class assignments and quizzes. Access to a computer and internet connection: You will submit all your materials online for this class, so there is no need for you to worry about printing costs. However, you will need to use a computer to type your papers and access assignments on Canvas. You will also need to access all our readings electronically. UNCC has a variety of computer labs available for students, as well as Wi-Fi. If you are having trouble accessing the necessary technology for any reason, please let me know ASAP so that we can get you what you need. A NOTE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY! This is a tech-friendly classroom, but I do have limitations. You may only have your laptops out during specific activities (I will give you permission). This is to help keep distractions to a minimum and give you a chance to practice your note-taking skills. I will make exceptions for people with specific accommodations, so make sure you talk to me if that applies to you! I will not police your cell phone use (you’re adults!), but I do expect that you will adhere to a few basic rules of professional courtesy. Keep scrolling, tweeting, DMing, texting, and surfing to a minimum. Sending a quick text or checking a notification is perfectly alright, especially if it’s fairly urgent (e.g., a work or family situation). Openly scrolling while someone else is talking? Nope, rude. Please don’t do that. NO HEADPHONES, EARBUDS, OR EARPODS ARE ALLOWED IN CLASS. Why? Because it sends the message that you’d rather be listening to something/someone else. Even if that’s true (and I expect it will be at least some of the time), it’s inconsiderate to the speaker(s) to show that. Life is going to be full of things you’d rather not be doing, but that are still important to be present for. I will make exceptions for people with specific accommodations, so make sure you talk to me if you need to have access to your headphones for any reason! If you receive a phone call that you must take, I will expect you to step out into the hallway, just as if you were in a professional meeting. No need to make a big deal out of it, just step out and step back in. Please do not FaceTime or video call in class. If your technology use becomes a distraction to me or to other students, I reserve the right to ask you to change your behavior. ASSIGNMENTS With the exception of our first mini-assignment (which will be submitted online) and your Packback reading discussions, all of our writing assignments and tests will be completed IN CLASS on paper. I have chosen this method because of a combination of factors: 1) I want to make sure that you are producing work from your own memory and knowledge, not the internet; 2) it allows me to build skills with you in a very concrete way; and 3) it helps me to motivate students to attend class regularly. Because many of these assignments are in class, they will technically be timed (since they are limited by the class period). I design in-class assessments to be completed in 50-60% of the class period; however, if you have an accommodation that includes extra time on tests and/or the need to type your responses rather than handwrite them, I will work with you to make sure that you have what you need. Writing Assessments: You will complete 10 writing assessments (“mini-assignments”) for me over the course of the semester. These will be worth 20 points each (or 20% of your final grade). Most of these will be completed in class and will help you build the skills you need to read and write at a higher level. In general, we will do these assignments on Fridays, though there may be exceptions as the schedule evolves. Packback: Packback is a software that facilitates more active discussions than a standard Canvas Discussion Board. The software will guide you through writing a strong discussion question, and then you will respond to two of your colleauges. You will complete one of these per week (minus the first and last weeks of the term), and they will be worth roughly 15% of your final grade. Packback does do the grading for me, but ultimately I make the final determination of your grade. I will also read the weekly reports and may use your questions to facilitate class discussions! More information about Packback and how it works can be found on Canvas. I am also happy to answer any questions or uncertainties you may have. Exams and Tests: You will take 4 unit tests for me (worth 25 points each), and one final “blue book” exam (worth 100 points). Together, these account for 20% of your final grade. I will provide guidance and study guides as we get closer to these dates. For now, remember that the goal of these evaluations is to help you show me what you know, not to trick you or punish you! MAJOR DUE DATES: GRADING NOTE: I do not offer extra credit! These are your only opportunities to earn points towards your final grade, so take them all seriously, even if they’re not “big ticket” assignments. GRADING SCALE 90-100 A 80-89   B 70-79   C 60-69   D 0- 59    F I will do my best to have your work graded and returned to you promptly. Smaller assignments (2 pages or less) should be returned within one week, but it will take up to two weeks for papers and exams. I will notify you of any delays. Your end-of-semester grade will not be rounded up to the next letter grade unless the following conditions are met: You are within one-half of a percent (0.5%) of the next letter grade. Your attendance, participation, and work over the course of the semester demonstrate reasonable effort and attempts at improvement. All assignments must be originally composed for this class. Assignments submitted from previous classes or current classes without prior discussion will receive a zero . LATE WORK Because most of our work is turned in in person, there will be no extensions or make-up opportunities for in-class work unless you have an excused absence (see attendance policies below). For work submitted online (e.g., our Packbacks), I will grant ONE extension per student, per semester, no questions asked. This extension will be for the following class period (e.g. from a Monday deadline until class starts on Wednesday). Simply email me to let me know you want to use your extension—you do not even need to tell me why unless you wish to. If you have a family or work emergency, additional extensions can be arranged on an individual basis. ATTENDANCE Attendance is required! I keep track of attendance for every class to help me evaluate participation, so missing class repeatedly will affect your final grade. Additionally, it is in your best interest to be here for as many classes as possible, as we will discuss readings, answer questions, and go over materials not covered in your readings. Excused absences: An excused absence is an absence that does not count against your participation grade, and in which you are able to make up any work that you missed. For your absence to be excused in this class, you need to communicate with me ahead of time , especially if it entails being absent for multiple days (e.g. long-term illness, jury duty, military/National Guard training). Depending on the circumstances, I may ask you for documentation. Regardless, the sooner you communicate about problems that affect your attendance, the easier it is for us to make arrangements. If you do not communicate with me, I can’t excuse the absence! Note: for test days, I require all absences to be documented (e.g., by a doctor’s note). An unexcused absence on test day means that you will receive a zero for the test and will not be able to make it up! Unexcused absences: Unexcused absences are absences that you do not communicate with me about. These absences will affect your participation grade, and I reserve the right to dictate whether and how missed work from these absences may be made up. In general, though, work missed from unexcused absences will not be able to be made up. A note about religious observances: All religious observances are valid reasons to miss class or need extensions. If you need to step into the hallway for scheduled prayer times, leave early to attend a service or ceremony, or miss class for a religious event, just let me know ahead of time. Any work/assignments missed for religious observances can be made up. PARTICIPATION Your participation in this class is graded based on your engagement during in-class activities. If you are an active part of group work, raise your hand to answer questions, or chat with me when I come around to check in, you will earn points for the day (3 pts max per day). Unexcused absences, falling asleep, being disruptive, or goofing around on your devices will all have a negative effect on your participation. You can also earn additional participation points for seeking additional help outside of class hours (e.g. coming to office hours or meeting with me to discuss your paper). I keep track of your attendance and participation in an Excel spreadsheet. Here is the math I will use to calculate this part of your grade: Count all of the points you have earned throughout the semester. This number represents your Total Points (TP). Calculate the total potential number of points you could have earned by adding your “Present” days and your “Absent” days (excluding your “Excused” days) and multiply them by 3 (the max number of points you could earn in a day). This number represents your Potential Points (PP). (TP/PP) * 100 = participation grade ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT AND PLAGIARISM You are expected to turn in your own original work for each assignment and exam. We will discuss citation and ways to avoid accidental plagiarism in class (that is part of what you are here to practice), but intentional copying of other students or online sources is not acceptable. Neither is  the use generative AI to produce class assignments (more details below). HANDLING ACAEMIC DISHONESTY As you might imagine, I think it’s very important for you to do you own original work. As such, I have a series of policies to manage instances of cheating and other academic dishonesty. First offense: you will conference with me to agree on a resolution. We’ll decide what an appropriate solution is based on the exact issue, but possible actions include supplementary lessons/workshops, alternate assignments, and/or manual re-writes. Second offense: I will file a report for official disciplinary action. I also reserve the right to recommend you for a first offense in severe/egregious cases. All students are deemed by the University to understand that if they are found responsible for academic misconduct, they will be subject to the Academic Misconduct procedures and sanctions, as outlined in the Student Handbook. If you are not familiar with these policies, I encourage you to review them. A NOTE ABOUT AI-GENERATED WORK In general, I am not opposed to using technology as a resource, and that includes AI. You’ll notice that our Packback software makes use of a type of AI software to help you craft your questions and to help me with the grading (though I obviously have override powers). In these contexts, our technology tools are very beneficial. Having said that, generative software like ChatGPT has evolved to the point where I can no longer easily distinguish between human work and computer work… which means that I can no longer have confidence in anything you produce on your computers. This is especially true for the content of this course because US History falls into a more “general knowledge” category (this makes it easier for all sorts of engines and large language models to scrape the internet for you). My current tech policy and reliance on in-class work is a reflection of that situation. Under these circumstances, I will regard all instances of generative AI use as cheating and deal with them under the university’s academic dishonesty policy (see above). ACCESSIBILITY The university is required (by law!) to accommodate any disabilities that you may have. If you have a disability that qualifies you for academic accommodations, contact the Office of Disability Services: Phone: (704) 678-0040; Email: disability@uncc.edu; In-Person: Fretwell 230. They will provide you with a letter that lists your accommodations, and will notify me so that I can make adjustments to class if necessary. These letters do not disclose what your disability is, so you do not need to worry about your professors knowing sensitive personal information. That said, if you want or need me to know your personal situation so that I can better accommodate you, come and talk to me. However, I will not ask you to disclose sensitive information, and you are welcome to keep your privacy. If you are struggling in class for any reason (medical or otherwise), please let me know! There is a limit to what I can do without an official accommodation letter, but there may be small things that I can change with little effort (ex: fonts on PowerPoints or assignment sheets; transcripts for videos). If you have personal concerns that present obstacles to your academic performance, I will do what I can to help you access the resources you need. I am happy to help support you in any way that I can, including guiding you to resources to manage things that are happening in your life outside of class. You have my promise (as a professional and a person of integrity) that anything you tell me will remain between us unless it is a question of your safety or the safety of others. However, you should be aware that I am a mandated reporter, which means that I am required by law to report instances of suspected abuse and discrimination, especially (but not limited to) those that occur on university property, by university personnel, or at university-sponsored events. I am required to report the following things: Gender-based harassment/discrimination Sexual harassment/abuse Abuse/neglect of children or the elderly NOTE: This syllabus is subject to change at instructor’s discretion. I will notify you of any changes. List of Documents We will be covering the following documents in this class.
